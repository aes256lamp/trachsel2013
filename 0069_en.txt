	The primary pharmacological effects of methamphetamine (1) are mediated by the 
increased release of the monoamines norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA).

	The enlargement of the N-alkyl group is accompanied by a significant loss of 
effectiveness, so that even N-ethylamphetamine (4) has little, if any, stimulating 
properties. If N- (arylalkyl) radicals are introduced, potent σ-receptor 
ligands (e.g. with structure 5) are obtained.
	2-Phenethylamine with (as well as without) an N-alkyl radical (structure 6) 
proves to be non-stimulating in humans as well as in animals (locomotion study). Here, too, 
highly potent σ-receptor ligands could be created with N- (arylalkyl) residues (structure
7).



	N,N-dialkylation (Chapter 3.2): While N, N-dimethylamphetamine (8) only 
has a weak stimulating effect, these effects disappear completely with higher alkylations. 
If an N-Me group is introduced into the σ-receptor ligands 5 or 7 mentioned above, 
for example, the σ-affinity is retained.
	A prominent representative of the N, N-dialkylated derivatives is selegiline (9). It is 
a selective, irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B and is used as a drug 
(Deprenyl, Movergan) to treat Parkinson's disease.
Interestingly, Prolintan (10) again shows psychostimulating effects with its longer side chain and larger N,N substitute (Section 3.2).
