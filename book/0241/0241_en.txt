Pipradrol (61) also has a hydroxyl group in the benzylic position. It was launched on the market in 1956 by the Merrell company under the name Meratran® (1mg) and was intended to treat depression and listlessness (Fig. 5). In the 1970s, Pipradrol (61) was marketed as a vitamin preparation (thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, choline, inositol) under the name Alertonic Elixir® and should also be used to largely alleviate mental listlessness. However, clinical studies with adult volunteers showed that Alertonic Elixir® had no significant effects on mood, memory function or appetite at the doses recommended by the manufacturer [86]. However, overstimulation has occasionally been reported at higher doses.
