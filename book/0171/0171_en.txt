3.9. ß,ß-Disubstituted Phenylalkylamines



As already mentioned with the ß-substituted phenylalkylamines (Chapter 3.8), Suter and Weston investigated in 1942 the influence of alkyl substituents in the ß-position of amphetamine (1) on toxicity and the influence on blood pressure [1]. They listed ß, ß-dimethylamphetamine (2) as the only ß, ß-disubstituted compound. Although it is said to have a higher toxicity than the ß-monosubstituted compounds, it was classified as still less toxic than amphetamine.

The phenylalkylamines 3 and 4 were synthetically described by Burger and Ong in 1962 [2]. Type 5 compounds are the same as compound 3; they were patented by Boots Co. in 1982 and were used to treat depression [3]. From this, substances such as 6 and 7 developed. Compound 7 (BTS 54 524) was indeed clinically investigated in depressed patients, but only caused an insufficient improvement in mood. Sibutramine, as substance 7 was later named, primarily reduced weight and was thus profiled for the treatment of obesity (obesity; BMI> 30kg / m2), since preclinical studies on healthy volunteers showed neither stimulatory nor sedative effects [4]. Sibutramine (7) inhibits the resumption of monoamines with the following strength: norepinephrine ~ serotonin> dopamine [5]. The anorectic effects are ascribed to these centrally acting effects (see also excursus anorectics). Sibutramine (7) was approved as a drug under the name Meridia® or Reductil® for the treatment of obesity in 1999, but sales had to be suspended at the beginning of 2010 due to cardiovascular side effects [6] (see also Chapter 6.3.8).
