Changes in the structure of the reuptake mechanisms are responsible [1]. Chronic methamphetamine consumption changes the structure of the brain, as demonstrated by imaging studies [23]. These studies revealed significant deviations in the brains of methamphetamine addicts in the regions responsible for emotions and memory. In certain areas of the brain, some of these defects appear to be reversible; these regions showed regeneration after two years of methamphetamine abstinence [23]. This went hand in hand with the better performance in specific memory tests. Within the same period, however, other parts of the brain had not recovered, which indicates a long-lasting change / destruction of certain regions [23]. Even after three years of methamphetamine abstinence, decreased levels of striatal DA transporters were found in humans. It is also well documented that methamphetamine (2) causes a long-lasting reduction in DA and its metabolites in animal experiments (rodents and non-human primates) [25].
All these studies, with often very detailed and costly experiments on the complex mechanisms of action, lead to the conclusion that methamphetamine (2) has a toxic effect on the neuronal level. The interested reader is referred to more detailed literature [1, 25, 26].

Methamphetamine (2) penetrates the nerve cell and displaces monoamines there; this not only increases the concentration inside the cell, but also in the synaptic gap. The neurotoxicity of methamphetamine seems to be dependent on these two increases in concentration [27]. Because methamphetamine (2) excessively increases the dopamine concentration, dopamine quinones and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed [25]. In addition, the extracellular glutamate levels are increased, which leads to an intracellular increase in the calcium concentration and in turn leads to the activation of NO synthase (NOS). This NOS now controls the formation of reactive nitrogen compounds (RNS). As the name suggests, these compounds (ROS and RNS) are highly reactive and can not only damage proteins, lipids and DNA in their environment, but also directly influence the energy production of the cell by inhibiting the mitochondria. Together with other cascading actions not described in detail here, important proteins can no longer be synthesized, such as the essential vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2).
This oxidative stress can lead to an altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier. This can possibly lead to an undesirable interaction with antipsychotic drugs that are used in methamphetamine psychosis [25]. It becomes intuitively clear how sensitively such cascade-like mechanisms are coordinated with one another. By changing this delicate balance, the damage can occur in all its dimensions.

Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH)

As with fenfluramine and phentermine, consuming methamphetamine (2) greatly increases the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension [28]. In a study with 340 participants who were diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) (due to no externally known cause), 29% had a history of stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine (2) or cocaine),
