Fencamfamin (44) was developed by the Merck company in the 1960s [45] and is now only rarely used to treat mental and physical weakness. It also shows an anorectic active component. Together with various vitamins, it is marketed as Reactivan® or Glucoenergan®, for example. It is used less and less because of abuse and addiction.
In America it appeared on the black market in the 1980s, where it was traded as a cocaine substitute under the street names "F" or "Fake" (fake cocain) [32, 33]. The abuse as a doping agent was documented as early as 1969 [32]. Some studies showed a clear ability of fencamfamin (44) to force animals to repeat self-administration [32, 34-36]. In a drug discrimination study, fencamfamine (44) was clearly substituted in cocaine-trained rats [33]. An increase in locomotion in animals could also be clearly demonstrated [37-39]. DeLucia et al. showed that fencamfamin (44) has anorectic effects in rats [38]. Studies of the pharmacological mechanism suggest an effect similar to that of amphetamine. Fencamfamin (44) is able to release dopamine [39-42] and also norepinephrine [40]. Fencamfamin (44) is also assigned an inhibition of dopamine reuptake [42]. However, in contrast to amphetamine, fencamfamine (44) showed no inhibition of monoamine oxidase [41].
Studies on the psychostimulatory effects of fencamfamine (44; 25mg and 50mg) in volunteers showed that not only a physical but also a psychostimulatory component is present [43]. Interestingly, sedating rather than stimulating effects were found at the low dose (which suggests a possible interaction with opioid receptors, compare the 'structural similarity to tilidine; 43). Furthermore, the administration of fencamfamin (44) has shown a temporary increase in mental performance [44].

In the 1960s, the Merck company investigated and patented compounds of type 45 in addition to fencamfamine (44) [45, 46]. The chemical basis (via Diels-Alder reaction) for such phenylnorbornane derivatives was published in 1951 by Parham, Hlunter and Hanson [47] and in 1961 by Weinstock et al. [48] created. The substances became one
