Serotonin. The name of this biogenic amine is derived from its effect on blood pressure: as a component of the serum that regulates the tone (tension) of the blood vessels. The biogenic amine, also called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), functions as a tissue hormone and neurotransmitter; it is found in the central nervous system, intestinal nervous system, cardiovascular system and in the blood. It is produced by the essential amino acid tryptophan (5). Serotonin (4) has a very significant influence on signal transmission in the central nervous system and is jointly responsible for our well-being, including the regulation of sleep, appetite, mood, aggression and perception. The at least 14 serotonin receptors found to date are divided into seven families: 5-HT1 to 5-HT7. There are different subtypes. Well-known antidepressants (see digression antidepressants), but also drugs for other mental disorders regulate the serotonin balance in the brain. More on the meaning of the serotonin receptors can be found in chapter 8.5.1. Melatonin (6), which is produced in vivo from serotonin (4), controls, among other things, the sleep-wake cycle.



Other drugs, such as Sumatripan (7), themselves have the basic tryptamine structure, which is also widespread in nature with psychoactive substances such as DMT (8) or psilocin (9). A brief overview can be found in the excursus on natural substances. A number of synthetic psychedelics, some of which are highly potent, were also created, such as the ergoline LSD (10). The standard work TiHKAL by Shulgin and Shulgin takes up psychedelic tryptamines and ergolines [1].
