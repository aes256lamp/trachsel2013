Van der Schoot, for example, showed that Pipradrol (61) can also increase motor activity: it was able to stimulate locomotion in mice (i.p.) by a factor of 0.25 relative to amphetamine [58].
The R stereoisomer of pipradrol (61) proved to be almost as potent as the racemate with regard to an increase in motor activity (mouse, p.o.) (stimulations were observed in the racemate from doses of 3 mg / kg) [87]. No CNS stimulation could be observed with S-Pipradrol. In vitro, pipradrol (61) appears to inhibit dopamine reuptake rather than release dopamine [88].

The piperidine ring in pipradrol (61) has been replaced by rings such as pyrrolidine (62), morpholine (63) and others (each attached in position 2) [89]. Among them, the 2-morpholine derivative together with the parent compound 61 proved to be the most potent compound. The five-membered homologue diphenylprolinol (62) was patented for the treatment of cocaine dependence; it probably acts - similar to cocaine itself - as an inhibitor of monoamine transporters [89-91].

In analogy to the two potent stimulants pipradrol (61) and deoxypipradrol (59), it can be assumed that the deoxy derivative 64 and diphenylprolinol (D2PM, 62) also act as stimulants. Various experience reports are circulating on the Internet and the substances have also been marketed as new stimulants over the Internet [130-131]. The compound 64 has so far only been little researched scientifically. Diphenylprolinol (62) is used in enantiomerically pure form as an aid in enantioselective synthesis (reduction of ketones to alcohols); Such compounds are called CBS (Corey-Bakshi-Shibata) catalysts [92]. 2- (Diphenylmethyl) pyrrolidine (deoxy-D2PM or 2-benzhydrylpyrrolidine, 64) is used industrially for the separation of the enantiomers of racemates.

Moving the hydroxyl group of pipradrol (61) into the 3-position of the piperidine ring also leads to potent CNS-active substances [93, 132]. For example, 65 was able to produce an increase in motor activity in mice (i.p.) at 0.3 mg / kg, while the highly potent amphetamine required a comparatively 1 mg / kg. The O-acetyl ester of 65 was found to be as potent as the parent compound 65 in this regard, and the N-methyl derivative (SCH-5472) showed the same potency as amphetamine.
