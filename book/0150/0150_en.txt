Why do fluorinated compounds have a special effect on humans?

A decisive reason can be the changed metabolism: As shown for the 18F radionuclide of D-glucose (18FDG, 12), the body, in this case a glucose transporter, is often unable to differentiate between glucose and the fluorinated form. In this way, the molecule moves zncognito through the body until its camouflage is blown and the regular path no longer continues. In many cases a specific enzyme is then inhibited. This camouflage often works when a certain HO group or a certain H atom is replaced by a fluorine.
This is also the case, for example, for the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (8). In principle, the enzyme thymidylate cyclase converts the pyrimidine base uracil (26) into the DNA building block thymine (27) with the help of the methyl group carrier methylene tetrahydrofolate. Thymine is essential for cell division and must be made from uracil in the body. If the synthesis is inhibited, no more DNA can be built up and the cells can no longer grow. This also reduces the growth of a tumor. The enzyme binds to the uracil in the active center, methylates it to thymine and regenerates itself again by splitting off the H in the 5-position of the uracil as H +. If the enzyme now finds a 5-fluorouracil, it would have to split off an F+ in order to free itself from the substrate, which is simply not possible. Thus, the 5-fluorouracil is covalently bound to the thymidylate cyclase and inhibits it for a long time [7]. Since the inhibitor molecule sacrifices itself irretrievably, so to speak, such ligands are also called “suicide ligands”.
