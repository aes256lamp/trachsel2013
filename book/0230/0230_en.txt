Such transporter inhibitors may even have an inhibitory effect on PAH (e.g. the SSRI fluoxetine). So far, no large-scale studies have been undertaken to test this, but experts agree that SSRIs have a beneficial effect on PAH [29].
In contrast to the SSRIs, some of the serotonin-releasing substances appear to be associated with PAH [26]. However, there are also some SERT substrates that release serotonin very potent and yet have not (so far) been associated with PAH (e.g. mCPP and MDMA,) [26]. The mode of action of the substances seems to be of central importance. It is not yet known which mechanism ultimately leads to PAH. Activation of the 5-HT2B receptor can increase plasma 5-HT levels [141] and thereby possibly also cause PAH.
Suhara et al. discussed the general importance of storing substances with a high affinity for serotonin transporters in the lungs. [31]. Using radiolabelled cyanoimipramine, they showed on test subjects that between 68 and 86 percent of the administered substance was absorbed in the lungs just 90 seconds after the intravenous injection and only up to two percent reached the brain around half an hour later. Pretreatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor clomipramine resulted in a much lower storage of the radiolabeled cyanoimipramine in the lungs, whereas the concentration in the brain was now more than doubled.
Langleben points out that clear preliminary investigations regarding PAH should be carried out with future anorectics in order to prevent the problem from recurring [17].

In a drug discrimination study (rats), Young demonstrated the ability of Aminorex (17) to substitute for amphetamine [32]. The stimulus effects were qualitatively the same as those of amphetamine, which has been confirmed several times [33, 34]. According to police and forensic reports, this fact encouraged illegal distribution, especially in the USA and Germany [35].


Table 1. The relationship between transporter activity, monoamine efflux and the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (PAH) from anorectics and other substances (including from [28]). The interaction with the NE neurotransmission is not taken into account.



a) reuptake inhibitor; b) no effect; c) Values from [30], phendimetrazine (101) seems to be a produr for phenmetrazine (100); d) values from [23]; e) With chronic intake, MDMA could induce mitogenesis in pulmonary artery cells [23].
