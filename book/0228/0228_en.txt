The pronounced hunger suppressing properties of Aminorex (17) ultimately led to this substance being investigated more intensively and then finding its way onto the pharmaceutical market as a potent anorectic (Aminoxaphen, Aminozaphen, Apiquel®, Menocil® etc., see also excursus anorectics) . In the 1960s, Aminorex (17) found widespread sales in Europe as a "diet pill" (Fig. 1). Between 1967 and 1969, however, there was a marked increase in fatal primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; high blood pressure in the lungs) in Switzerland , Germany and Austria, which was clearly related to the use of the appetite suppressant Aminorex (17) [17, 18]. Because of this very serious finding, Aminorex (17) was finally withdrawn only three years after its market launch (1965-1968) from the market. "Only" some of the patients treated with Aminorex (17) developed PAH. Since a certain occurrence of PAH has never been observed in animal models, a certain genotype is suspected to be sensitive to it [19]. The risk for the The development of PAH in people with a high predisposition is said to be 6-fold increased with a single intake of certain anorectics and 23-fold increased with a longer intake [19]!

After the link between Aminorex (17) and PAH was uncovered, the question of the mechanistic connection arose. Aminorex (17) increases the serotonin concentration in the brain (after the serotonin transporter-mediated uptake of 17 into the serotonergic cell and the subsequent release of
