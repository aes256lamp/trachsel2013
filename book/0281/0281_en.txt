In order to get to the bottom of the structural analogies and the binding properties to the serotonin 5-HT2A and histamine H1 receptors, Shah et al. investigated a number of substances that are on the one hand the AMDA and on the other hand the basic structure of the H1 antagonist diphenhydramine ( 20) are similar to [15]. They investigated the question of whether a selectivity between the two receptors can be achieved with structural variations (Table 2). The antihistamine diphenhydramine (20) was previously used primarily for the treatment of allergies (Fig. 2), but is now only used for nausea and because of its sedative effect against insomnia. There are experience reports on the Internet about the changed, dream-like experience with abusive high doses of diphenhydramine (20). Diphenhydramine (20, K = InM) has a high affinity for the [3H] mepyramine-labeled H1 receptor [16].
As can be seen from Table 2, only a moderate H1 vs. 5-HT2A selectivity could be achieved, and the most potent derivative (31, Ki = 0.5nM vs. 22nM) also turned out to be one of the most selective [15]. The high affinity for the H1 receptor is not surprising; it is structurally related to diphenhydramine (20).
In general, the ring-closed derivatives (1, 29-31 and 33-37) show higher affinities than the ring-open counterparts (5, 38-45). From the sterically less restricted diphenylalkylamine derivatives to the tricyclics, the H1 affinity is retained or it is increased. On the other hand, opening the middle six-membered ring towards diphenylalkylamine derivatives is generally associated with a significant loss of affinity, especially at the 5-HT2A receptor.



In contrast to the affinities for the 5-HT2A receptor [1], increasing N-alkylation of AMDA (1) has a positive effect on the affinity for the H1 histamine receptor [15]; for this, 30 (Ki, = 25nM) showed about ten times higher affinity than AMDA (1, Ki = 197nM) and 29 (Ki = 189nM, see Table 2). The N, N-dimethylation open-
