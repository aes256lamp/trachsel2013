endioxy groups and an imidazole in which their nitrogen atoms are embedded. Some have an MDMA substructure and have been shown to be leukotriene B, receptor antagonists. The leucettamine A (98) [31] shown here can theoretically be interpreted as condensed bis-MDMA. Leucettamine B (99) was also found in marine environments [32]. The question arises as to whether MDMA (94, Ecstasy; see Chapter 7.5.6) can eventually be identified as a natural substance after all.

Sulfur in peptides, proteins and small molecules plays an important role in nature. These sulfur compounds from plants, bacteria, fungi and animals often have unique chemical and biochemical properties that are not only related to redox processes [33]. The substance class of the Varacine is
