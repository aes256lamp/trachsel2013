genes by Van der Schoot in 1962 animal experiments [8]: Phentermine (1) was able to increase the locomotion in mice (i.p.) with a relative potency to amphetamine of 49%.

    The N-methyl analogue mephentermine (2) showed a relative potency of 37% in the experimental set-up for locomotion [8] - its potent increase in blood pressure was recognized [9], and finally mephentermine (2) was marketed for this purpose (formerly Trade names: Angiofen®, Mephin®, Vialin®, Wyamin® etc.) [10].

    α-Ethylamphetamine (3) was found to be inactive in the locomotion test with mice (i.p.) [8]. The homologation of amphetamine to a-ethylphenethylamine (see Chapter 3.6) also led to a significant loss of effectiveness [8].
Pentorex (4) was used briefly as an appetite suppressant (brand name: Modatrop®) and produced a low level of psychomotor stimulation. It was withdrawn from the market because of increased psychological dependence, schizophrenia and cardiac arrhythmias [11].



    Compound 5 can be viewed as a cyclized analog of phentermine (1) (by incorporating the two terminal methyl groups into a cyclopropyl ring). It was originally investigated as an analogue to the potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) tranylcypromine (6, see Chapter 3.11) and proved to be only weakly active in terms of this effect (in vivo potentiation of tryptamine-induced convulsions in rats) [12]. However, 5 showed a marked anorectic effect in different animals. In rats, 5 was found to be around a third and in dogs around a quarter as potent as (+) - S-amphetamine [13]. The most common side effects mentioned were slight restlessness and occasional increased motor activity in dogs. The cardiovascular effects were comparable to those of comparable anorectic doses of amphetamine [13]. Furthermore, with regard to the anorectic effects in rats, derivative 5 was found to be slightly more potent than the structurally related phentermine (1) [13]. Nevertheless, it was apparently not developed further to make it marketable. The discovery of these anorectic properties led to a number of additional structures, generally represented by compound 7
