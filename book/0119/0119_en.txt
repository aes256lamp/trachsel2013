showed a significantly reduced effect [23]. It was also significantly less toxic, did not induce aroused behavior in cats, and appeared to be more of a sedative than a stimulant.
 

Verbiscar and Abood tried to delay the effect of physiologically active amines by using carbamate esters (latency) [24]. In general, this chemical modification increases the lipophilicity of the substances, which are better protected from enzymatic degradation. The authors derivatized, among other things, phenethylamine, amphetamine and ephedrine to eight different carbamate esters, which led to the compounds 20-22. The radical R denotes a phenyl ring with or without electron-withdrawing and donating substituents. The most active compounds showed a biphasic spectrum of activity, characterized by an initial mild sedation, which was then immediately followed by a moderate stimulation. The anorectic effect in the test animal was accompanied by significantly less central stimulation than is known from amphetamine (the most active compounds had the structure 21 and showed only around a tenth of the CNS stimulation of amphetamine). Within the phenyl-substituted derivatives, the most active compounds had substituents with an electron-withdrawing character. This was explained by the simplified cleavage of the carbamates and the resulting release of the amines.


Another idea of latenting the effect and the onset of action in the form of prodrugs, i.e. slowly releasing the actual active ingredient metabolically, was proposed by Weiner et al. examined [25]. They bound phenethylamine, amphetamine, ephedrine and tyramine to polymethacrylic acid (radical polymerization of the methacrylamides previously formed, e.g. structure 25, Fig. 2), which resulted in structures 26-28. Copolymers were also produced by reacting methacrylamides with methacrylic acid, vinyl acetate or vinyl pyrrolidone.
