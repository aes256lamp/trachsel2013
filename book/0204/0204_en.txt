31-33 have been described synthetically by Burger and Ong [22]. The cyclobutanols 34-35 investigated Miller et. al on their ability to potentiate the adrenergic effect of (-) - norepinephrine [23], with only the trans derivative 34 exhibiting potentiation. The two compounds can be viewed as conformationally restricted analogues of norephedrine. However, 34 only showed about 1% of norephedrine's potency.



The homologous 2-phenylcyclopentylamine 36 was mentioned in a patent in 1950 [24]. The inventor gave an indication that such compounds should have applicable pharmacological properties, but without specifying them. 36 was also mentioned synthetically in 1956 [25]. It failed to inhibit MAO and produced an increase in blood pressure in dogs [26].



Compounds 37-42 have a six-membered ring as an alicyclic and were prepared as rigid structural analogues of amphetamine [27]. They should provide information on whether amphetamine (see Chapter 2) has different effects in different specific conformations. The cisoid structures (39-42) produced an increase in motor activity in mice (i.p.), the transoid (37 and 38) reduced it .

Tilidine (43, Valoron®) is a synthetic opioid that has an analgesic effect 5 times weaker than morphine [28]. It is mainly used in Switzerland and Germany. In the USA it is in the "Schedule I" class, i.e. tilidine (43) is recognized as having neither therapeutic nor medical benefits and is therefore prohibited [29]. In the organism it is metabolized into an analgesic (μ-selective agonist) active N-demethylated compound [30]. Because Tilidin (43) not only suppresses pain, but also suppresses fear, violent juvenile criminals got into fret about fights and assaults with Tilidin [31].
