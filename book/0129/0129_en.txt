Summary

Due to their similarity to the pharmacologically successful beta blocker backbone, numerous phenoxyalkylamines were examined for their cardiovascular effects, but also for MAO-inhibiting properties, especially in the mid-1960s. Special attention is paid to the substituent in the 2-position for antihypertensive properties (see Chapter 6.1.2). In order to inhibit the MAO, a cyclopropyl group on the nitrogen or in the side chain turned out to be important (see also excursus on amine oxidases).
