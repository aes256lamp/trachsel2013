It was hoped that when these compounds entered the body, the active amines would be released by slow hydrolysis [25]. The general behavioral changes were observed in mice and the effects on blood pressure in cats were measured. In general, the polymeric amides showed longer-lasting effects than the monomeric amides of methactylic acid.


The toxicity of the polymeric compounds was found to be much lower than that of the free amines [25]. Furthermore, the effect of the free amines was often contrary: For example, a copolymer with integrated amphetamine showed a sedating activity, although like the other (co) polymers and amphetamine itself, it was able to increase blood pressure. N-methacryloylamphetamine (monomer of 27) itself was devoid of any effect. Other copolymers of amphetamine sometimes showed stimulation and / or hyperpnea (increased breathing) in the test animals. In contrast, the tested compounds with phenethylamine instead of amphetamine lead to hypopnea (decreased breathing). In cats they had only a weak effect on blood pressure [25].
