Further fluorinated 2C-T derivatives were manufactured by Trachsel [13] and are described in detail in Section 8.5.7. The new, commercially available F-reagents nowadays enable simpler chemical reactions and thus novel explorations of old, known structures. In already known 5-HT2A receptor ligands, H atoms can be systematically exchanged for fluorine atoms [13-15]. Fluorine also shows its potential here, and in addition to affinities, especially the effects in humans can be significantly influenced. The new, fluorinated derivatives not only have a different duration of action and dose, but they also sometimes show a significantly different color of the changed state of consciousness. This could be observed, for example, in the F-analogous mescaline derivatives [15] (structures 33-35; see also Sections 8.4.8.2, 8.4.8.3 and 8.4.10 for other fluorinated scalins). A methoxy group can be viewed as relatively polar, as the electronegative oxygen with its lonepair electrons can function well as a hydrogen-bond acceptor. The electron-withdrawing properties of fluorine mean that in the case of an O-CHF2 group, and even more so in the case of an O-CF3 group, the H-acceptor properties of oxygen are lost. This makes this point significantly more hydrophobic or lipophilic [6].



The compounds 36-38 [15] and 39 [16] are fluorinated analogues of the empathogen 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 40). They could serve to clarify the significance of possible metabolites or change the spectrum of action of MDMA by influencing the interaction with the monoamine transporters (see also Sections 7.5.7.4 and 8.1.1).
