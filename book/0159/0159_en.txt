but not as a Relcaser. Substance 16 also bears the name PPAP, but should not be confused with the sigma ligand (-) - RN- (3-phenylpropyl) -1-phenyl-2-aminopropane (known as (-) - R-PPAP, see Chapter 3.1.1.2). Because of the bis-phesnylalkylamine structure of 17 and 22, it can be assumed that they could also be ligands of the sigma receptors (cf. publications by Glennon et al. In Chapter 3.1.1.2).

Substance 24 is called lefetamine (rarely also lephetamine; R-configuration). Together with various diphenylethylamine derivatives, it was tested for its analgesic properties in 1945 [10]. Lefetamine (24) has a stimulatory, but also an analgesic property [11]. It has similarities to the simple phenethylamine derivatives, which enables an interaction with the dopamine and norepinephrine transporter (inhibition of the reuptake of DA and NE). Due to the additional analgesic effect, an opioid-like effect was suspected [12], and binding to opioid receptors was later confirmed [13, 14]. Lefetamine (24) was also found to be a moderate NMDA antagonist and neurotoxicity is suspected [15]. After it was first widely abused in Japan during the 1950s [11], it also appeared on the illegal narcotics market in Europe, particularly in Italy [11]. Similar results were found during searches of an illegal laboratory in 2008 [16].
