to the 5-HT2A receptor again significantly worse. Interestingly, with a C4 chain (36, Ki = 32nM) the affinities increase again and are almost in the same range as AMDA (1) itself. In this case the distance is the same as with chlorpromazine (21), which is used as an antipsychotic Dopamine, histamine and serotonin antagonists work. This affinity kink in a homologous series could suggest a different mode of binding.

As part of the investigations into AMDA (1), the affinity of compounds was also investigated that had one or more substituents on the aromatic part (substances 50-56, Table 3, summarized in [1]). The R1 substituents in 50-56 are primarily those that have proven themselves in 4-substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamines: a substituent in the para position to the alkylamine chain determines both the affinity and the functional activity on the 5th -HT2A receptor (see chapter 8.5). While DMA (46) has no appreciable affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor, the 4-substituted derivatives 47 and 48 have high affinities. DOB (47) is an agonist and DOPP (48) an antagonist (see Section 8.5.4). With a suitable (large, lipophilic) 4-substituent, phenethylamines with a relatively affinity for this binding site can be achieved even without the 2,5-dimethoxy substitution, but these are antagonists (e.g. 4-PPPEA, 49, see Section 7.2.1). The same substituents were tested on the AMDA derivatives (see Table 3).
