Poos et al. published their studies on 2-amino-5-aryloxazoline derivatives in 1961 [6]. In contrast to the aforementioned compounds 11-16, these compounds (structures 17-19 and 21) do not have a carbonyl function on the oxazoline ring. They realized that substance 17 (Aminorex) is a potent anorectic with CNS-stimulating properties. They also tested substances 11 and 17-21 for their ability to inhibit the ingestion of rats (p.o.). Compounds 19-21 were found to be inactive at the dosages tested. The ED50 (oral dose which inhibited food intake by 50% in rats) of compound 17 was, with a value of 5.8 mg / kg, comparable to that of (+)-S-amphetamine (6.8 mg / kg).
