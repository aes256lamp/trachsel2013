Essential oils with phenylpropane structure -
or the "nutmeg mystery"

The fragrances 71-86 occur in the natural essential oils of plants and spices. They come from the secondary metabolism of plants and are not phenethylamines.



The pioneer Alexander Shulgin coined the idea that essential oils with a phenylpropane structure could be metabolically converted into amphetamines (87) and chemically produced a series of so-called essential amphetamines, which bear the substitution pattern of the corresponding essential oils.
Starting from the 1-propenyl derivative 88, an isomerization to the
2-propenyl derivative 89 can be carried out. With tetranitromethane, the corresponding nitrostyrene 90 is formed, which can then be reduced to amphetamine 87 [27].
The extent to which the conversion into an amphetamine derivative can take place metabolically in vivo is also discussed again and again [28]. The reason for this assumption is the fact that nutmeg, which contains safrole (71), elemicin (73), and myristyin (74), has a psychoactive effect when taken in high doses (see also Section 7.5.6.2). In the case of in vivo transamination, the substances MDA (91),
