Summary

Methamphetamine largely loses its stimulatory properties by introducing a second N-methyl group. The N-propargyl methamphetamine is known as selegiline (16) and is used in Parkinson's disease. If nitrogen is included in a cycle, prominent representatives are e.g. fentanyl derivatives, which are used as synthetic opioids, or pyrovalerones, which inhibit the dopamine / norepinephrine transporter and act as stimulants. A number of N, N-disubstituted phenethylamines that have a phenylalkyl radical on nitrogen are highly potent ligands of the Sigma receptor.
