Substance 17 was found to be a potent anorectic in various animals and in this regard was about a third as potent as amphetamine [9] (the close structural relationship to phentermine can be seen; see Chapter 3.7). Therefore a large number of derivatives (substituents on aromatic and nitrogen) have been prepared and investigated [10]. Some substituents on the aromatic were able to slightly increase the effect, others reduced it. The substitution of nitrogen reduced the anorectic effect in general. Some N- and N-N- (di) substituted derivatives of compound 19 were reported years later by Teotino et al. examined for their MAO inhibition and compared with tranylcypromine (1) [11]. It was found that none of the substances was able to inhibit the activity of the MAO. However, some derivatives proved to be CNS-active (rats; i.p. or s.c., e.g. increase or decrease in motility, anorectic effects).

In 2004, fluorinated derivatives (among other things 22-25 and their diastereomerically pure isomers) of tranylcypromine (1) were examined for their MAO-inhibiting properties (as inhibitors of tyramine oxidase from Arthrobacter sp.) [12]. The derivative (±) -trans-2-fluoro-2-phenylcyclopropylamine (23; called "fluorotranylcypromine") was around 10 times more potent than tranylcypromine (1). Subsequently, the influence of substituents on aromatic compounds was investigated [13] and how the enantioselectivity develops [14]. The trans-N, N-dipropyl-tranylcypromine 26 was investigated with many other structural relatives for the interaction with serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 24nM, [3H] -8-OH-DPAT displacement) [15]. Milnacipran (27; (±) cis) [16] is a mixed selective reuptake inhibitor for norepinephrine and serotonin (SNRI) and was approved as an antidepressant in 1997 (Ixel®), Dalcipran®) [17]. The spiropentane derivative 28 would be a further possible modification, which, however, has not yet been described (the amine-free compound is described synthetically in [18]).



The next larger alicyclic compound has the cyclobutane backbone. In 1960 the homologous 3-phenylcyclobutylamine (29) [19] and in 1961 2-phenylcyclobutylamine (30; each racemic cis and trans derivative) [20] were described. However, these tranylcypromine analogs were found to be inactive with regard to their MAO inhibition [21]. The derivatives
