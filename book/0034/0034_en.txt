N-acetyl mescaline (52) isolated. With an orally effective dose of 180-360mg, mescaline (49) is a little potent, but nonetheless a very intense psychedelic. The neuronal mode of action of mescaline and other synthetic scalins has not yet been fully clarified; mescaline (49) acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor agonist. In addition to mescaline (49), compounds of type 53 were isolated very early on, but it was not until 2008 that lophophine (54), which until recently was considered synthetic, was found in the well-studied and mescaline-containing cacti Lophophora williamsii (peyote) and Echinopsis pachanoi (San Pedro) (formerly Trichocerens) identified.

Thyroxine and thyronamine derivatives. The thyroxine derivatives denote amino acids (55 and 56), while the "thyronamines (57 and 58) represent their decarboxylation products. The amino acids are mainly found in the thyroid gland. Little is known about the corresponding biogenic amines, 'T4 (55) and T3 (56) play a key role as thyroid hormones in our glucose, lipid and protein metabolism, while the thyronamines (57 and 58) have modulatory effects on the trace amine receptors (TAAR) [18-21].


Seco-1-benzyl-isoquinoline derivatives. This group includes a relatively large number of diverse alkaloids from the plant kingdom. Starting from the aporphine (59) backbone, cutting bonds leads to phenanthrylethylamine (60) and finally to 2- (phenethyl) phenethylamines (61). Both classes of compounds have not been very well investigated; phenanthrylethylamines such as argentinine (62) are often described as cytotoxic [22]. Some derivatives also appear to be useful in the treatment of diabetes [23]. The other compounds shown (63-70) are a small selection of sero-1-benzyl-isoquinolines with a phenethylamine structure (Seco comes from secare and means cut). A larger selection of such interesting phenethylamines can be found in The simple plant isoquinolines by Shulgin and Perry [24]. Structurally, all of these compounds have a 2-phenethyl radical. Unfortunately, most of these compounds have not yet been extensively investigated pharmacologically. Narcein (63) has an antitussive and weak analgesic effect [25, 26].
