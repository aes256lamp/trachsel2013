were the same with 3.8% in the patients with known risk factors. After taking into account the different age groups and statistical data analysis (95% confidence interval, P <0.0001), the conclusion could be drawn that patients with idiopathic PAH used stimulants ten times more often than patients with other forms of pulmonary hypertension.

Methamphetamine as a worldwide drug

Recently, the consumption of the so-called ATS (Amphetamine Iype Stimulants) has stabilized, both on the provider and on the consumer side [29]. The steep development during the 1990s has leveled off at a similar (high) level since the turn of the millennium. The report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) attributes this stabilization to the increased controls of the preliminary stages as well as the various measures to contain consumption [30].
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are around 25 million regular amphetamine / methamphetamine users. This prevalence of around 0.6% of the world population of 15-64 year-olds is only exceeded by cannabis and takes second place among illegal drugs, ahead of cocaine and heroin. 15-16 million people use methamphetamine (2). More than half of the amphetamine or methamphetamine users live in Asia [30].
If one looks at the global seizures (2000-2005) of the ATS [30], 49% are accounted for by methamphetamine (2), followed by 15% by amphetamine. The rest are shared by MDMA (14%) and other, not precisely defined ATS (22%). Of the 17 tons of methamphetamine (2) seized by the authorities in 2005, 63% came from East and Southeast Asia and 36% from the United States.
The estimated illegal production of amphetamines (amphetamine and methamphetamine (2), excluding MDMA,) amounted to 370t in 2005, of which 290t is methamphetamine (2) and 80t is amphetamine, and has been similarly high in recent years [30]. Estimates come about as follows: 1.) Confiscation of ATS, 2.) Confiscation of preliminary stages, 3.) Estimation of ATS consumers. The authors describe the difficulty in giving an exact trend that results from the fluctuating values.
Typically 0.1-1g per day is required, for chronic binge users it can be up to 5g. In order to meet this demand and to supply the consumers with methamphetamine (2), the market has found enough ways and means.
Illegal “meth” is produced either in large, industrial so-called “superlabs”, which can produce multikilo quantities in one production cycle, or in small methamphetamine kitchens that typically produce gram quantities [29, 30]. Individual large-scale plants have the capacity, if the starting substances are available, to synthesize several hundred kilograms per week. It is believed that 80% of the methamphetamine (2) consumed is produced in such “superlabs”, even though there are thousands of small underground laboratories in the US alone.
Production, although widespread geographically, is concentrated in the United States, East and Southeast Asia, Oceania and some European countries. The authors of the report note that South Africa has recently become a production location [29].
In 95 percent of the cases, methamphetamine (2) is produced in laboratories discovered around the world (mainly kitchen laboratories). The number of laboratories discovered was in 1990
