    The N-demethyl analogue of ephedrine (1a), norephedrine (2; the stereochemistry was not specified in the publication), like ephedrine (1a), showed almost no increase in locomotion in mice (ip, 4% activity relative to amphetamine) [4 ]. On the monoamine transporters, (+) - and (-) - norephedrine (2a and 2b) showed an activity comparable to that of ephedrine (1a) [6]. The two cathine stereoisomers 2c and 2d lost their ability to release dopamine compared to amphetamine [6].

    The two phenethyl analogues 3 and 4 were found to be inactive in the locomotion test in mice (i.p.) [4]. In principle, ligands for adrenergic receptors can also be obtained with the phenylethanol skeleton. Etafedrine (5) is still used as a bronchodilator in some countries today. Due to the larger alkyl residue on nitrogen, the substance loses its monoamine-releasing properties and gains affinity for adrenergic receptors. In the case of etafedrine (5), a β2 agonist is produced [7].


    The concept of adding sterically demanding groups such as isopropyl or tert-butyl groups to nitrogen in order to obtain affinity for ß-adrenergic receptors seems to be viable, but has no effect on functionality. There are a number of adrenergic agonists with this basic structure, but also antagonists (ß-blockers, see also Chapter 6.1.2). The substituents on the aromatic ultimately decide whether a substance is an agonist or an antagonist. Orciprenaline (6), terbutaline (7) and salbutamol (8) act as ß2 agonists and are used as bronchodilators in asthma. The phenolic HO groups prevent penetration of the blood-brain barrier, which is why no central effects can be expected. Methoxamine (9) as an α1 agonist mainly increases blood pressure.
    Dichloroisoprenaline (10) and sotalol (11) are antagonists of ß-adrenergic receptors, i.e. ß-blockers that lower blood pressure. Sotalol (11) is used to treat irregular heartbeat and hypertension.
