structurally closely related to the lissoclinotoxins. Both were isolated from the sac- or bulbous invertebrate sea squirts (Ascidiae or Ascidiacea). The aryl tetra-substituted varacins (100-103) are discussed in Section 9.1. There are also a number of 5- (methylthio) varacins (104-107) that are arylpentasubstituted and are therefore also discussed in Section 10.3. Varacins have strong antifungal and cytotoxic properties, the latter presumably due to their DNA-damaging effect. The 5- (methylthio) -varacins, but especially the dimethyl derivative 107, have been shown to have pronounced cytotoxic, antimicrobial and antifungal properties, compound 107 also inhibits protein kinase C [34] (summarized in [35]).

Connections 108-110 also come from the marine environment (see Chapter 9.1). In 1994 Searle and Molinski isolated the derivatives lissoclinotoxin A (108), Lissoc. linotoxin â‚¬ (109) and lissoclinotoxin D (110) from the tropical sea squirt Lissoci num sp. from the Great Barrier Reef | 36]. Because of the limited inversion of the pentathiepine ring, they describe lissoclinotoxin A (108) as chiral. Lissoclinotoxin A (108) and lissoclinotoxin D (110) show a fungicidal effect against Candida albicans. Lis soclinotoxin A (108) is structurally to be regarded as O-desmethylvaraein.
The lissoclinotoxins E and F (111 and 112, see chapter 10.3) as well as lissoclibadins 1-3 (113-115, see chapter 10.3) are dimers and trimers of a substructure of N, N-dimethyl-5- (methylthio) varacin (107, also see Chapter 9.3). They, too, were isolated from a tropical sea squirt (Lissoclinum badium, native to the Indonesia area) and tested for their ability to inhibit cell profiling. Their cytotoxicity was also determined. Lissoclibadine 2 (114) was identified as the most interesting compound. In relation to human colon, breast, kidney and some lung cancer cell lines, 114 was over 100 times more active than cisplatin without showing any high general toxicity [37].
