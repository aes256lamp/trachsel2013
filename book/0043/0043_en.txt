In the human body, histamine (125) is involved in various processes as a tissue hormone and neurotransmitter, and the four known histamine receptors are frequent targets for drugs. The H1 receptor plays a central role in allergic reactions. H2 antihistamines are used for allergies and sleep disorders. H, antihistamines are used to reduce gastric acid secretion. The H3 receptor is the subject of current CNS research. As a classic heteroreceptor, it regulates the release of dopamine (29), serotonin, norepinephrine (31), GABA and acetylcholine.
The conceivable and hoped-for areas of application range from ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to depression, control of the sleep-wake rhythm and regulation of appetite. So far, however, there is no H3 antagonist on the market. Histamine H4 antagonists, like H1 antagonists, could be used in asthma and allergic reactions.

Various methylhistamines. Metabolites of histamine (125) are also found in humans. While N-methylhistamine (126) occurs only in traces, N-methylhistamine (127) is a main metabolite [45]. The formation of the respective metabolites is strongly influenced by a number of CNS-active drugs [46, 47]. The methylhistamines 127-129 are also found in amphibians and sponges [48].


Ergothionein (130) is a naturally occurring, but not proteinogenic amino acid. It was first developed in 1909 from the ergot fungus found on rye. (Claviceps purpurea) and is found in various bacteria and plants as well as in the human body in sperm [49]. The exact biological function remains largely not understood, even more than a hundred years after its discovery [50].
