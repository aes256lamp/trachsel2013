to replace quaternary carbon in 4,4-diphenylpiperidines with a silicon atom (structure 76) [107].
The Si-C bond is longer than the C-C bond and, as a result of different electronegativities, more polarized, which can ultimately lead to significant differences in physico-chemical and biological properties. The Sila derivatives have a higher lipophilicity and a somewhat higher affinity for the opioid receptors [107]. The synaptosomal uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin was significantly more strongly inhibited by the silicon analogues [107].



The pethidines (77), prodines (78; inverse esters of pethidines) and the fentanyls (79) have an additional function in the 4-position of the piperidine and thereby achieve a strong increase in the affinity for opioid receptors. They are all categorized as synthetic opioids and are only shown here to illustrate the structural relationship.

The antipsychotically active compound haloperidol or its decanoate ester (80), which acts as a retarding, releasing prodrug, is also derived from the N-substituted 4-phenylpiperidines and belongs to a certain extent to the proline family (78). However, it has a very pronounced effect as a dopamine and serotonin antagonist and shows almost no interaction with opioid receptors.
