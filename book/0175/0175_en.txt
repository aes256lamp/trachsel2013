3.10. Phenylalkylamines with varied amino positions


    Up until 1910, the two pioneers George Barger and Henry Hallet Dale were probably the first to present descriptions between the structure and physiological effects of organic substances of the "amine" type [1]. They obtained many of the chemically pure compounds by isolating them from putrescence (putrid necrosis). The starting point for aromatic alkylamines was 2-phenylethylamine (PEA; 4) identified in rotten meat, of which the blood pressure-increasing effect was already known at the time.
    In one part, they examined aromatic (alkyl) amines such as aniline (1), benzylamine (2), 1-phenylethylamine (3), 2-phenylethylamine (4), 3-phenylpropylamine (5) and a few others for those influencing blood pressure Effect, it turned out that aniline (1) and benzylamine (2) as well as 1-phenylethylamine (3) had no effect on blood pressure (.v .; cats). However, there was a big jump when the side chain was lengthened to two carbon atoms, resulting in 2-phenylethylamine (4). 2-Phenylethylamine (4) showed an optimal effect with regard to the increase in blood pressure, because the further homologation of the side chain to 3-phenylpropylamine (5) already leads to a significant decrease in potency. Thus, a 2C unit (for definition see also Section 8.5.2) between the aromatic and the amine is optimal in order to obtain a sympathomimetic effect.
    After all, it was Barger and Dal who gave birth to the term “sympathomimetic” [1]. Substances that act like ephinephrine (= adrenaline) on the smooth muscles of the sympathetic nervous system are referred to as sympathomimetic. Depending on the receptor profile, these substances can develop effects such as broncholysis, vasoconstriction, vasodilation and also central nervous excitation.
