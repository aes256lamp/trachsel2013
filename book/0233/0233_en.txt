the analogous synthetic conversion of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine leads to 3,4-dimethylaminorex (29).



Substances that carry a sulfur atom instead of oxygen have only been sparsely investigated. Molecules of type 30 (R = H, Me, Et etc.) are only described synthetically. The derivative 31 showed weak hypnotic properties [41]. Compound 32 was mentioned in a patent and is said to be used in the treatment of diseases due to abnormal NO production [42].
Another modification is the replacement of the exocyclic nitrogen with a carbonyl function. The pharmacological properties of these cyclic carbamates were only shown, if at all, in extremely high doses. The minimum effective dose for producing various effects (e.g. CNS or analgesic activity) was given for 33 (R = H and Me) 150 mg / kg (p.o., mouse) [43]. What is striking is the similarity of 33 with the nootropic Carphedon (34).

The imidazoline derivative tolazoline (Priscol®) is a competitive, nonselective α-receptor antagonist that is rarely used today [136]. Its vasodilator effect could be used in severe peripheral circulatory disorders (e.g. also caused by 5-HT2A / C agonists such as DOB, see Chapter 8.5.27.4) [134, 135], and today tolazoline is still found in occlusion of the central artery of the retina of the eye Mission.
