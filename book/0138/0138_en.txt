The hydroxy group of ephedrine (1a) was further modified to give thio-analogous compounds. McCarthy and Ho produced 2-mercapto-2-phenethylamine (25) in 1961 in a paper that was carried out in collaboration with the medical research and development department of the US Army [15]. They tried to get a substance that had radioprotective properties. The idea arose from the fact that the hydroxy compounds epinephrine and serotonin showed a certain protection against radioactive radiation and that these amines are well distributed throughout the body. The analogous compounds with electron-withdrawing sulfur [16] should enhance these properties. Foye reports on the potential use of sulfur compounds as radioprotective aids (protection against nuclear attack) [16]. See also the S connections in Chapter 7.3.6.

The two compounds thioephedrine (26) and its disulfide analogue 27 were compared with ephedrine (1a) in various animals [17]. The sympathomimetic properties of 27 were significantly weaker than those of ephedrine (1a), and thus 27 showed a negligible effect. MAO activity was more strongly inhibited by 26 and 27 than by ephedrine (1a). In 1965, Bhat and McCarthy continued to produce the dimethyl derivative 28 with the aforementioned radioprotective intentions [18].
In Japan, too, it was hoped that such derivatives would provide radio protectors. Shinoda et al. investigated a number of compounds of structure type 29 and 30 in 1978 [19].

Derivatives analogous to 31 have been shown to be therapeutic agents against schistosomiasis, a worm disease that is spread in warm inland waters by snails as an intermediate host [20].
