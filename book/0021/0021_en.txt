being inhibited by it [28]. D-amino acids are often not recognized by the actual targets (enzymes, transporters and other proteins), which leads to abnormal pharmacodynamics. The most relevant interaction proteins for an effect of an amino acid in the CNS are the aromatic amino acid transporters, which actively transport the essential aromatic amino acids into the brain, and the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, which vitamin B6 requires as a cofactor [29].

Despite the very short half-life (due to the rapid degradation by MAO), phenethylamine (1) has received a great deal of attention as an endogenous amine. The reason for this lies in its ability to potentiate catecholaminergic neurotransmission [19]. Fuxe et al. found that phenethylamine (1) releases dopamine and norepinephrine from presynaptic endings [30]. This means that it acted as a releaser or reverse transporter in your test system, similar to amphetamine. The increase in motor activity in test animals treated with an MAO inhibitor was ascribed to the increased release of dopamine [31].

Finally, a popular scientific and rather critical note on phenethylamine (1): In some places it can be read that phenethylamine (1), which actually occurs in cocoa products, creates feelings of happiness and is addictive when eating chocolate. However, whether the amounts of phenethylamine (1) contained are really pharmaceutical
are macologically relevant is rather doubtful.
