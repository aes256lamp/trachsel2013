3.5. Phenylalkylamines with heteroatoms on the side chain

The insertion of heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, halogens or another nitrogen on the side chain in turn enables access to a large number of new compounds. The best-known derivative is the naturally occurring ephedrine (1a), which chemically belongs to the phenylpropanolamine derivatives. Ephedrine (1a) is the main alkaloid of the Chinese drug Ephedra or Ma-Huang and is found in ephedra species, including monkshood, berry grapes and the Kath shrub Catha edulis [1]. It was first isolated from Ephedra vulganis by Nagayoshi Nagai in 1885. Ephedrine (1a) is an oral sympathomimetic: it increases blood pressure, stimulates the heart, widening the bronchi and suppresses the appetite. It is therefore used against hypotension (Fig. 1), chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks and to reduce the swelling of the mucous membranes in the event of a cold. The appetite-suppressing effect was also used. Only [1R, 2S] - (-) - ephedrine (1a) occurs in nature. Its enantiomer [1S, 2R] - (+) - ephedrine (1b) is produced synthetically.

The naturally occurring enantiomer 1a unfolds in doses of 20-60mg a mood-enhancing and euphoric effect, which is accompanied by significantly increased alertness and can last for two to eight hours [2]. At higher doses, the peripheral effects manifest themselves as tingling on the skin and the formation of goose bumps in places (pilomotor reflex), and severe palpitations are also observed. The synthetic enantiomer 1b shows a much weaker effect [2].
