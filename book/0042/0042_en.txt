Why simple organisms originating from the sea such as sea squirts build such complex and for us exotic molecules is still unclear today. The exotic marine phenethylamines often have sulfur, bromine or iodo atoms on their scaffolds. There is great interest in new lead structures that are suitable for us as potential active ingredients for the treatment of various diseases. Only a small part of this valuable treasure chest has been examined, and it is to be hoped that mankind will take good care of this treasure so that we can continue to discover and marvel at new things from the sea in the future.

A little insight into the heteroarylethylamines

Afterwards, a little insight into the world of heteroarylethylamines will be given. It is obvious that this does not do justice to this class. The isoquinolines or the indoles alone with their tryptamine derivatives comprise innumerable natural substances; therefore only a brief overview is given. The interested reader is referred to further literature.

Imidazole derivatives (see chapter 4.6). As the name suggests, the amino acid L-histidine (124) occurs in young plant tissue. Although it has an aromatic, it does not come from the shikimic acid pathway, but from purine bases. The histidine (124) can be converted into histamine (125) by the histidine decarboxylase.
