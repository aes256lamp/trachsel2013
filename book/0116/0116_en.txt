Finally, the potent MAO inhibitor pheniprazine (2) was marketed as an antidepressant; it was one of the first commercially available MAOIs. However, it was later taken off the market again because of its liver-damaging side effects. In rats (ip), pheniprazine (2) was only able to strongly stimulate motor activity for 1-10 hours at doses of 30 mg / kg [6] (amphetamine already shows at Img / kg a significant increase in locomotion). Oral administration to mice also caused an immediate increase in locomotor activity [7]: Cristofoli et al. measured the concentration of amphetamine in the urine and in the brain of the rat after administration (i.p.) of pheniprazine (2) and found considerable amounts [8]. The metabolism of pheniprazine (2) to amphetamine is presumably so pronounced that the observed increase in physical activity can be ascribed to the metabolite amphetamine. Another problem with the medical use of pheniprazine (2) was the so-called tyramine or cheese effect [9] (see excursus on amine oxidases).

Phenelzine (1) also found its way onto the pharmaceutical market and has been used since the late 1950s under the market name NardilÂ® for the treatment of atypical depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (Fig. 1) [10]. Similar to tranylcypromine (see chapter 3.11), phenelzine (1) has a nonselective activity on MAO-A and MAO-B [11] and is thus able to increase the levels of 5-HT, NE and DA, which is the pharmacological principle of action [ 12]. Due to the pronounced inhibitory effect on the MAO, a corresponding low-tyramine diet is required. Panic attacks can also be treated with phenelzine (1) [13]. The anxiolytic properties are attributed to the ability of phenelzine (1) and its metabolite phenylethylidene hydrazine (8) [12]. Both increase GABA levels in the brain.
Furthermore, phenelzine (1) was previously tested as a possible treatment for bulimia [14] and as a prophylactic agent for migraines [15]. There is a risk of liver damage when using phenelzine (1) [16], especially if the liver is already damaged.

Lespagnol, et al. produced the two N-oxide derivatives 9 and 10 [17]. Her idea was driven by the fact that despite the many chemical modifications of biologically active compounds, the N-oxides were not investigated. Compound 9 produced hypertension in dogs previously treated with chloral hydrate at 5 mg / kg (IV),
