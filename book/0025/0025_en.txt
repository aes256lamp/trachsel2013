The shikimic acid (1) is now converted to the phosphate ester 8, which then reacts with another molecule of PEP (2) to form horismic acid (9). The phosphate ester formed in 8 serves as a leaving group. The chorismic acid (9) itself is also subject to an intramolecular Claisen rearrangement and forms prephenic acid (10) through chorismate mutase.
