Affinity to Sigma receptors (Ki = 11440nM ([3H] DTG exchange) [99]. With suitable substitution on both nitrogen atoms, ligands (eg 84) were obtained which bind to Sigma receptors in the deep nanomolar range [99] .



A piperazine derivative that has become popular in recent years and is touted on the black market is 1- (3-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (85; mTFMPP, "Molly"). In the psychonaut scene it is called an entheogenic entactogen [111]. The dosage is given between 25 and 100mg; Depending on this, the effect expresses itself, from entactogenic (related to the effect of MDMA, see chapter 7.5.6) to psychedelic (in the direction of LSD, psilocybin, etc.). Very different experiences and effects are reported.
mTFMPP (85) binds to various serotonin receptor subtypes 5-HT1A in the nanomolar range; 5-HT1B; 5-HT1D; 5-HT2A; 5-HT2C) [44, 112, 113]. Baumann et al. also demonstrated that it is a potent substrate of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and capable of releasing serotonin, analogous to the neurobiological effects of MDMA [113]. However, this effect was at least three times weaker than that of MDMA. In contrast to the unsubstituted 1-benzylpiperazine (73), mTFMPP (85) is not a locomotor stimulant.

In general, 1-phenylpiperazines apparently have a relatively unspecific affinity (especially binding to various serotonin receptors), and so far there are no detailed studies on (aromatic) monosubstituted 1-phenylpiperazines to show a structure-affinity relationship. Greater attention should be paid to this class of substances, as various derivatives were found in street samples. There are currently more than 50 1-phenylpiperazines substituted on the phenyl ring commercially and inexpensively available, so that further 1-phenylpiperazines could soon come into circulation.

1-Benzylpiperazine (73; BZP or A2) has also become increasingly popular in recent years. Its psychotropic effects are similar to those of amphetamine (psychostimulant, no changes in the visual area, see also Chapter 2), although a higher dose is required (50-200mg vs. 5-50mg [47]) and the duration of action is shorter (3- 5h vs. 4-6h; with higher amphetamine doses, effects of up to 30h have been reported [47]). It was probably the legal status and the easy availability at low prices that led to the increasing occurrence of 1-benzylpiperazine (73). Eventually it was included in the Narcotics Act in many countries.
