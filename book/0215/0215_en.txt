Treatment of Parkinson's Disease. Lazabemid (18) is the only reversible MAO-B inhibitor on the market [14].

There are, however, some reversibly binding MAO-A inhibitors. Moclobemide (19), harmine (20) and metralindole (21), a derivative that is particularly widespread in Russia, should be mentioned here. All three bind reversibly and selectively to the MAO-A, which is why they are often referred to as RIMA (reversible inhibitors of MAO-A). The class of RIMA is marketed as antidepressants and has less pronounced food intolerance due to both reversibility and selectivity. Harmine (20) is a natural substance that is of no importance as a medicinal product [15]. The reversibly binding inhibitors fit into the binding pocket of the active center and compete competitively with the natural substrate.



The MAO also has an allosteric binding side. Since all ligands that fit well to this binding site and thus inhibit enzyme activity have an imidazoline backbone, one also speaks of an imidazoline binding site. It was found that this so-called imidazoline binding site is not associated with the cofactor FAD. The ligands idazoxan (22) and cirazolin (23) are also Î±2 antagonists, and antazoline (24) is a first-generation antihistamine. Since the ligands have an indirect influence on downstream processes, one also speaks of an I2 receptor, which is localized on the enzyme. This allosteric binding pocket has not yet been used therapeutically, however, drugs of the imidazoline type could be examined for their ability to inhibit MAO so that there are no interactions [16].
