3.12. Phenylalkylazacycloalkanes



The incorporation of the basic nitrogen from the phenethylamine pharmacophore into a ring structure leads to a very large number of pharmacologically active compounds. Such substances are counted among the azacycloalkanes. The class is characterized by structural diversity with a wide variety of pharmacological effects, and some derivatives have made the leap onto the pharmaceutical market.

3.12.1. Aziridines

The smallest aza cycle is represented by the tripartite aziridine. The synthesis of 1-phenylaziridine (1) and the 2-phenylaziridines 2-5 was described, for example, by Brois in 1962 [1]. The positional isomer 2-phenylaziridine (2) can be viewed as a phenethylamine analog in which the nitrogen is attached to the benzylic carbon atom. It showed monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity [2], which Wells et al. In 1966, the N-substituted 2-phenylaziridines 6 (R = methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, 2-phenethyl) and 1- (2-phenethyl) aziridine (7) were also tested for this ability. In vitro (homogenate from rat liver) all compounds showed an inhibition, but not as pronounced as the MAO inhibitor iproniazid. Structure 3 is a cyclized amphetamine analog in which the amine function is linked to the benzyl position, and compound 5 can be viewed as a cyclized phentermine analog (see Section 3.7).
