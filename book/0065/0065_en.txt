summary

First synthesized in 1887, amphetamine (1; alpha-methylphenethylamine) was originally developed as an asthma drug in the late 1920s, marketed as an inhaler decongestant in the early 1930s and launched a few years later as a remedy for mild depression. Because of its euphoric and stimulating (side) effect, amphetamine (1) was increasingly used in the army and officially administered to soldiers during the Second World War.
The epidemic widespread abuse together with the high potential for addiction ultimately led to a far-reaching ban. Due to the simple chemical synthesis, its spread on the black market is still very topical. Amphetamine, which has no affinity for the dopamine receptors, develops its effect mainly through increased release (reverse transport) and inhibition of the reuptake of dopamine (7) and norepinephrine (8). In addition, the metabolic breakdown of dopamine (7) is slowed down. The increased levels of dopamine and norepinephrine create the effects in all their complexity. The enantiomers of amphetamine sometimes differ significantly in their pharmacological profile. Amphetamine is still used today in various formulations as a drug (Adderall® and Vyvanse®) for the treatment of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
The fascination for this small molecule probably lies in its simplicity and the complex changes in humans. For decades, medicinal chemists have tried and still try to change the basic structure in such a way that desired properties emerge and undesirable side effects lose their activity. During this time, several hundred structurally analogous compounds were synthesized and investigated (see the following chapters, in particular 3.1, 3.3 and 6.2).
