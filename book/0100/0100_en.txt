ne forms) [42]. The increasing size or chain length of the substituent causes a higher affinity, and so the (+) - S isomer of 34 showed a Ki = 6.3nM.
Shortly afterwards it was found that, for example, (-) - R-PPAP (29) simultaneously shows a higher affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (IC ,, = 115nM) [43]. Therefore a number of compounds were prepared with the aim of finding a σ / 5-HT1A selectivity. In addition to various compounds already mentioned, 37-38 were also measured [43]. The (-) - R enantiomer of compound 38 showed a σ / 5-HT1A selectivity of 1: 163 with an o-affinity of K = 1.2nM and an S-HT1a affinity of K = 195nM.
Around the same time it was discovered that there are subpopulations of the σ receptor (σ1 and σ2 receptors) [44]. Glennon et al. examined the structural requirements within the phenylalkylamine group and finally designed a binding model for the σ1 receptor (review and SAR) [45]. Little is known about σ-receptor ligands and their effects. It is assumed that agonists can have an antidepressant effect [46].
