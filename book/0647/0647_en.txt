8. Trisubstituted phenylalkylamines

It can be assumed that the other two substituents of the three series mentioned, the 3,5- 2,5- or 2,6-dimethoxy residues, are needed to form bonds with their lone-pair electrons via hydrogen bonds to the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor. This has been studied in more detail for the 2,4,5-series (see Chapters 8.5.21 and 8.5.27.2) and it has been recognised that this appears to be true at least for agonistic interaction with these receptors. If large, lipophilic 4-substituents are present, high affinities can still be achieved without the MeO groups; however, the interaction is then antagonistic in nature (see Chapters 7.2.1 and 7.3.4).
The importance of the 4-substituent, the MeO groups and their arrangement are also supported by the following facts. If one of the MeO groups or the 4-substituent in a class is removed, the resulting compounds lose their affinities for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, and they are also no longer or barely active in humans (the resulting disubstituted phenylalkylamines are described in the corresponding chapters, see Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. The importance of the MeO groups for high 5-HT2A receptor affinities as well as human potency can be seen by selectively removing one MeO group at a time. The resulting disubstituted compounds exhibit few of the properties mentioned. The same is generally true when the
4-substituent is removed.
