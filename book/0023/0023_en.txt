Excursus:
Natural substances with a basic phenethylamine structure


Diffuse definitions

Chemical substances that are obtained from animate or inanimate nature are called natural substances. The term nature or its social interpretation is related to historical epochs and fills entire books.
The Duden defines nature as follows [1]: “The totality of organic and inorganic phenomena that exist or develop without human intervention. Substance, substance, matter in all forms of appearance. "
According to this definition, petroleum is just as much a natural substance as the delicate rose fragrance components or snake venom. The definition is already vague at this level. The definition of the term for “alkaloids” is even more problematic. she
uses attributes such as "naturally occurring, not generally widespread compounds with one or more nitrogen atoms in the molecule" [2]. The group owes its name to the basic nature of many representatives, derived from "alkali-like" [2]. In other definitions, only phytonutrients are referred to as alkaloids. There are more exceptions than rules: For example, animal ingredients, non-basic alkaloids with an acid amide structure, quaternary ammonium compounds, lactams and N-oxide derivatives are also listed as alkaloids. It is difficult to distinguish it from other N-containing natural substances: biogenic amines, pyrazines, pterines, vitamins and their derivatives as well as amino sugars and antibiotics are generally not counted among the alkaloids. Special cases ultimately determine the classifications, which are ultimately arbitrary and, depending on the author and the state of research, more or less broad.
The number of alkaloids described to date is over 12,000 [2]. Alkaloids are often biologically active, which has been used for millennia. As is the case with opium, which is one of the oldest medicines [2], although here the borderline between luxury goods is fluid. Coca, tea, cocoa and tobacco have been used as luxury goods since prehistoric times [2].
Whether arrow poison or medicine, mixtures of active ingredients from plants, literally “drugs”, were mostly used. The term “drug” as a name for pharmaceutically active substances comes from Dutch etymologically (drog, dt .: dry). The Duden defines it as follows: “Herbal or animal material made durable by drying, which is used as medicinal, seasoning and technical purposes” [1].
This excursus deals with substances that were created without human influence and that contain a phenethylamine structure. Many other possible connections that arise through the metabolism in humans, animals or plants have so far been little or not at all researched. The focus is on substances from nature that have an aromatic ring.
