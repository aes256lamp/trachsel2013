That phendimetrazine (101) has a spectrum of activity comparable to that of amphetamine has been shown, for example, by drug discrimination studies in monkeys [121]. Phenmetrazine 100) and phendimetrazine (101) were found to be roughly equipotent in their ability to substitute for amphetamine when administered orally. In humans, too, phenmetrazine (100; 25 and 50 mg; p.o.) was able to substitute for amphetamine (10 mg; p.o.), and the subjective effects are comparable to those of amphetamine [122]. Interestingly, phendimetrazine (101) could not maintain self-administration when administered intravenously (rhesus monkeys) [123]. This suggested that phendimetrazine (101) acts as a prodrug of phenmetrazine (100), which was finally suggested by Rothman et al. was underpinned [30]. His group investigated phendimetrazine (101) and phenmetrazine (100) as well as the stereoisomers 100a-d of phenmetrazine for the interaction with the monoamine transporters.
