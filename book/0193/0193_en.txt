Unhappy with Prozac?

Fluoxetine (30) is examined in more detail as an important representative, as its impact on society was enormous. The active ingredient "Lilly 110140" first appeared in a scientific publication in 1974, then 13 years passed before fluoxetine (30) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of depressive patients in 1987 [33] (see also Chapter 3.10) Lilly discovered that the trifluoromethyl group on the phenoxy ring improves the inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) by a factor of 6 compared to the aryl-unsubstituted compound and, in turn, the ability to inhibit NE reuptake by a factor 200. Fluoxetine (30) was therefore made more selective than the unsubstituted compound by a factor of more than 1000. On the other hand, substituents in every position in the phenoxy ring reduce the potency for 5-HT reuptake inhibition , CH3, fluorine, and chlorine. This basic structure has been intensively investigated, and so in a patent by Eh Lilly are several dozen derivatives which also have heteroaroma th, described synthetically with the associated IC50 values for inhibiting reuptake for NE and 5-HT [36].

Fluoxetine (30) is still on the market as a racemate. The reason for this could be that the R and S enantiomers inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT to a similar extent (summarized in [33]): Ki R isomer: = 21nM and S isomer: ~ 16nM. Interestingly, this changes with the metabolites. In the corresponding N-demethylated compound norfluoxetine (31), the S isomer is 14 times more potent than the R isomer (20nM vs. 268nM). The plasma half-life of fluoxetine is 1-3 days and that of the metabolite norfluoxetine (31) a remarkable 7-15 days. The usual dosage is 20mg per day.



Lilly celebrated the approval as a scientific breakthrough, and the marketing forces named fluoxetine (30) as the first SSRI, which prompted Carlsson to correct this view in a publication, since zimeldine (29) was the first SSRI active ingredient [7]. Nonetheless, fluoxetine (30) became famous under the name ProzacÂ® and quickly developed into the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the world [33].
Not only are the sales figures, the media interest and social relevance, but also the scientific research. By 1995 over 5500 methodological contributions had been written; In mid-2012 there were already almost ten thousand, which results in an average of over 260 scientific publications a year,
