The compounds 9-10 [8], 11 [9] and 12-14 [10] were used to elucidate the structural requirements for ligands of the sigma receptors. With the help of the numerous derivatives, Glennon et al. mostly a small influence of an existing α-Me group on the affinity, and also the stereochemistry (R / S) played a rather subordinate role in the investigated compounds. Removal of the N-Me group tended to lower affinities. Since the stereocenter has relatively little influence, most of the compounds were investigated as α-unsubstituted phenethylamines (see Section 3.2.2). With a binding constant of Ki = 0.25nM, the phenethylamine 14 proved to be a so-called superpotent sigma ligand [10] and was found to be around ten times more affine than (+) - 5-10 (Ki = 2.6nM [8], [3H] DTG) marked, σ-total binding affinity).

Cyanomethyl methamphetamine (CMMA; 15) is produced to a large extent when methamphetamine is smoked with tobacco [11]. Sekine et al. showed that CMMA (15) influences stereotypical behavior and spontaneous motor activity in mice and rats almost as potent as methamphetamine. Examination of the plasma showed that the main metabolites of CMMA (15), namely amphetamine and methamphetamine, are responsible for the stimulating effects. It is isoelectronic with the well-known MAO-B inhibitor selegiline (16). In view of this, it is surprising that the compound has not been further studied for its pharmacological properties. However, the propargylamine group is essential for the MAO-inhibiting properties of selegiline (16), just as with rasagiline (see Chapter 3.13), as it is responsible for the covalent bond to the enzyme (see excursus on amine oxidases).
