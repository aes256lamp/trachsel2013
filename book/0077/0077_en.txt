Piperidines and thereby receive a strong increase in affinity for opioid receptors. They are among the synthetic opioids and therefore have a primarily analgesic effect. Substances of type 59 have a stimulating effect with small substituents (Me, Et), while a t-butyl residue produces the centrally acting anti-Parkinsonian drug budipine. Phencyclidine (60; phenyloelohexylpiperidine, PCP for short) and ketamine (61) are dissociative compounds and act as open-channel blockers on the NMDA receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartate), which is one of the ionotropic glutamate receptors. There are a number of related NMDA receptor antagonists (structure type 62).
