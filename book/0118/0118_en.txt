14 showed a significant decrease in blood pressure (Amg / kg; anesthetized flunde), which is contrary to amphetamine, because this generates an increase in blood pressure. However, 13 and 14 shortened the sleep time of mice treated with hexobarbital and caused KR typical stefeoijpe behaviors and the increased motor activity known from amphetamines. The results for 13 and 14 were confirmed by Venugopalan and Jenkins in 1985 [20].


Guanethidine (15) was used as an antihypertensive agent under the name Thilodigon® and has a local anesthetic [21]. It reduces the release of catecholamines such as norepinephrine and thus affects the sympathetic nervous system; therefore it is also known as an antisympathotonic. Green et al. derivatized a number of phenethylamines to guanethidine-analogous compounds (e.g. 16-17) and hoped, among other things, for more selective and more potent active ingredients [22]. The (-) - enantiomer of the β-hydroxy derivative 17 as well as the racemate proved to be more potent than guanethidine (15) with regard to the depletion of norepinephrine (Mäuscherz). The levels of catecholamines in the brain or in the adrenal glands were not significantly decreased. The sympathetic blockage was determined by the extent of ptosis (drooping eyelid). In contrast to guanethidine (15), none of the compounds tested was able to produce a comparable sympathetic block.


Benington ex al. showed that by attaching a hydroxy group to nitrogen in amphetamine (compound 18; N-hydroxyamphetamine) the effects are largely retained (e.g. motor activity and pressor effects) [23]. MAO inhibition was somewhat more pronounced, and cats treated at 18 showed unusual circular head turning and profuse saliva. Compound 19 (N-methoxyamphetamine)
