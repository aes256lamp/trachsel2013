Table 3. Relative potency of compounds 2-4 and 6-12 to amphetamine with regard to the increase in locomotor activity in mice [33].

The appetite-suppressing effect of amphetamine (1, see Table 2), which was soon discovered, was of course not unused (the uses of amphetamine are discussed in detail in Chapter 2). Amphetamine (1) showed a very strong anorectic effect, but no one was able to successfully lose weight with it in the long term, at least not without the strong side effects (see also excursus anorectics). The numerous side effects drove the researchers to search for new, more selective active ingredients. In order to find an active substance against obesity that works by suppressing appetite, the following alicyclic N-substituted amphetamine compounds 13-17 were investigated in 1963 [34]. The food intake of normal and substance-treated rats (doses of 0.011 and 0.044 mmol / kg) was compared. Only cyclopropylamphetamine (13) was found to be an effective appetite suppressant, at least in this experiment. Cyclobutylamphetamine (14) already showed a much weaker effect, and the remaining compounds 15-17 were inactive in this test,
