tyrosine (12a) can be both decarboxylated and hydroxylated on the aromatic ring. Thus, it is a precursor to tyramine (23), dopamine (29), norepinephrine (31), and epinephrine (32).

Tyramine (see Chapter 6.3.1) As a decarboxylation product of tyrosine (12a), tyramine (23) is found in many plant and animal foods: The most prominent representative is also the namesake: cheese (gr. ?????, pron. tyros, dt .: cheese), chocolate, beer, red wine, salami, soy products, yeast extract, avocados and many more. The biogenic amine tyramine (23) is transported into the cell interior by the norepinephrine transporter (NET), where it is quickly broken down by the MAO and therefore has almost no effect in humans. In combination with MAO inhibitors, it acts as an indirect sympathomimetic and thus releases norepinephrine in the periphery, which can lead to severe headaches and even a life-threatening increase in blood pressure (see also the excursus on amine oxidases). One speaks of the “cheese effect”. Tyramine (23) is also an endogenous ligand at the trace amine receptor (TAAR). In insects it is considered a messenger substance in the nervous system.

Leptodactyline (24, see Section 6.2.3.3) has been identified in extracts from fresh or dried amphibian skins from over 140 species (not bufonids). Leptodactylidae is the name given to a widespread family of frogs (Anura). This zwitterionic phenethylamine acts as a muscle relaxant at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and is not available orally. Octopamine (25, see Chapter 6.3.1) has been isolated in the salivary glands of octopuses. It acts as a neurotransmitter and modulator in the nervous system of insects, spiders, snails and crustaceans. It is also advertised online as a diet drug because of its sympathomimetic effects. Synephrine (26, see Chapter 6.3.1) is found naturally in various plants, above all in citrus species, and especially in the bitter orange (Citrus aurantium). A number of entries on the Internet tout synephrine (26), similar to ephedrine, as a performance-enhancing and fat-burning agent. It acts as an α-sympathomimetic and as a ß3-agonist [7, 8]. Hordenine (27, see Chapter 6.3.1) occurs in various plants. Similar to ephdrin and tyramine (23), it shows a blood pressure-increasing effect. In locusts it acts as a feeding inhibitor [52].

Chloramphenicol (28) is a widely used antibiotic that has been in use since the 1950s. It was isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae and is now rarely used due to its side effects (possible bone marrow depression) [9].
