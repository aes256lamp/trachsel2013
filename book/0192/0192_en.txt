would have like the administration of a serotonin releaser, namely immediate mood-enhancing effects [32]. Another current attempt to explain this is based on the fact that antidepressants increase the level of a protein, the Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), after a while, which ultimately leads to the antidepressant effect [55].



Again there is an antihistamine model ...

As with the discovery of imipramine (15), an antihistamine also played an essential role in the new generation of antidepressants. Various researchers at the end of the 1960s were of the opinion that not only norepinephrine (NE) is of central importance in depression, but also serotonin (5-HT) [8, 33]. The consistent search for selective compounds that would interact less with the histamine receptors, but aimed at the effects of serotonin reuptake inhibition, began with diphenhydramine (27, see also Chapter 3.15): an agent that has been known since the late 1940s and as an antihistamine was approved also inhibited the reuptake of serotonin, as Carlsson and Lindgvist showed in the late 1960s [34]. From this point onwards, various chemists modified the framework in small iterations, which finally led to the first marketed serotonin reuptake inhibitor via brompheniramine (28) in 1982: zimeldine (29). Due to serious side effects, this active ingredient disappeared again a year later [35] to leave room for a blockbuster: fluoxetine (30, see also Chapter 3.10).
