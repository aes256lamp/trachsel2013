There are also interesting representatives among the phenylpropylamines. Various Î²-aryl-oxy-phenylpropylamines act as inhibitors of the monoamine transporters and can be found in many antidepressants, e.g. in the well-known fluoxetine (Prozac; 43).




Derivatives with a cyclic side chain (Chapters 3.11 and 3.12)

This class of substances is extremely diverse. A distinction can be made between the phenylalkylcycloalkylamines (Chapter 3.11) and the phenylalkylazacycloalkanes (Chapter 3.12).

One of the best-known alicyclic derivatives is tranylcypromine (44; Chapter 3.11). It is a non-selective and irreversible MAO-inhibitor and is used in special cases to treat depression or anxiety disorders. Fencamfamin (45) is a psychostimulant which releases DA and NE (Chapter 3.11). It was marketed under the name Reactivan for the treatment of mental and physical weakness, but has largely been withdrawn from the market today.

The simplest phenylalkylazacycloalkane is aziridine 46 (Section 3.12.1). It formally has the amphetamine structure, but in animal studies it did not produce any motor stimulation. Due to its reactive structure, this compound can be considered toxic.
Important representatives of the phenylalkylazacycloalkane class are, for example, pemoline (47), aminorex (48) and 4-methylaminorex (49) (Section 3.12.3). Pemoline (47) is a psychostimulant that inhibits the resumption of DA and NE. It was marketed primarily for the treatment of narcolepsy and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Because of its side effects, pemoline (47) is only used as a drug under special conditions.
The structurally related Aminorex (48) also found its way onto the pharmaceutical market as a potent anorectic. However, it was directly linked to primary pulmonary hypertension (PAH; high blood pressure in the lungs), so it was quickly withdrawn from the market. Aminorex (48) is also a
