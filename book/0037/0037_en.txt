Form TMA (92) and MMDA (93), which then produce the actual effect. Later studies showed that safrole (71) probably does not contribute to the psychoactive effect, but rather elemicin (73) and myristicin (74) in their unchanged form are responsible for it.


Recent studies indicate that the metabolic conversion may not be the reason for the psychoactive effects of nutmeg [28]. Since safrole (71) is also used for the illegal synthesis of MDMA (94; ecstasy, see Chapter 7.5.6.2)
