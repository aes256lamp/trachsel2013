to test. The analogue 107, which is direct to Phenmetrazi (100), has at least been described synthetically [140].



2-Benzylmorpholine (108) can be regarded as an isomer of phenmetrazine. However, it showed no stimulation at doses of up to 200 mg / kg (dogs; p.o.) [124]. The suppression of appetite was given with an ED50 of 3-5mg / kg. With a chronic application of 10 mg / kg for 20 days, however, the appetite-suppressing effect decreased again.




The oxygen atom in morpholine has been replaced, but in a different context. Compounds of type 109 have been patented as effective antiarrhythmics [125] and further described as radio protectors [1 26] (see also the sulfur compounds in Sections 3.5 and 7.3.6). Compound 110 has only been described synthetically and was used for spectroscopic investigations (1H and 13C-NMR) [127]. Compounds of type 111 have also been patented (manufacture) [128] and investigated in connection with antispasmodics [129].
