Effects due to changes in blood pressure and heart rate. They indicated comparable activity for the two primary amines.



Motivated by the even more complex rigidization of amphetamine, Nelson and Sherwood described the synthesis of the two molecules 39 and 40 [33]. At doses of 25 mg / kg (i.p. mouse), no increase in motor activity was observed, as can typically be observed with amphetamine at 1 mg / kg. A few other compounds with various ring systems (41-44) are from Smissman et al. investigated and described synthetically. In rats, 43 and 44 produced catalepsy [34]. Further rigidizations were undertaken at 45 and 46 [35]. These compounds decreased motor activity in mice.
