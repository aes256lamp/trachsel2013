Norephedrine (see chapter 3.5) Removing the N-methyl group of the four stereoisomers of ephedrine leads to the four stereoisomeric norephedrines 17a-d (the prefix Nor means N without a remainder). 17a is referred to as (-norephedrine, 17b as (+) - norephedtine, 17c as (+) - cathine or (+) - pseudonorephedrine and 17d as (-) - cathine or (-) - pseudonorephedrine.

N-methylephedrine (18) is also found naturally in ephedra. It has been tested as a broncholytic agent and is used today for colds and as a treatment for coughs.

S-cathinone (19, see Chapter 3.5) occurs mainly in the leaves and young twigs of the Kath shrub (Catha edulis).
The mode of action is similar to that of ephedrine (46a). On the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa the leaves are
and the young twigs used as intoxicants. Increased libido and willingness to perform as well as euphoria and talkativeness are typical effects. In the case of habitual cath abuse, apathy prevails [2]. It was only discovered in 1981 that cathinone (19) is the actual active principle for the stimulating effect of the plant. This late discovery may have been due to common isolation practices. During the extraction process the relatively unstable Î±-aminoketone comes into contact with acids, bases and atmospheric oxygen and dimerizes to a diphenylpyrazine (20) [2].

Tyrosine and its regioisomers. The naturally occurring L-tyrosine (12a; L-Tyr, see Chapter 6.3.1) is a non-essential amino acid for humans, as it can be produced from the essential L-phenylalanine (14a). It was isolated from cheese by Justus von Liebig in 1860 (Greek Tpog, pronounced fyros, German: cheese). L-Tyr (12a) is almost tasteless or slightly bitter, whereas the synthetic D-Tyr (12b) tastes more sweet.
In addition to L-tyrosine (12a), the regioisomers zeta- and ortho-tyrosine (21 and 22) occur in nature. They arise from L-phenylalanine (14a) by hydroxylation with free radicals under conditions of oxidative stress [6]. As described in chapter 7.5.1
