In a patent from 1964 some compounds of the aminooxazoline type are also mentioned [36]. The authors confirm that substances which do not have the aryl part in position 5, as in Aminorex (17), but in position 4, are free of the CNS-stimulating effects. Compound 22 (also known as Rexamino) turned out to be inactive. They also mentioned that the aromatic oxazole 19 was free from such an effect. In a drug discrimination study, neither of the two stereoisomers of Rexamino (22) could substitute for amphetamine (rats, 1 mg / kg (+) - amphetamine) [34]. From these investigations it can be concluded that for the protein-ligand interaction the distance between the aromatic and the endocyclic nitrogen atom in position 3 is a more critical parameter than the distance to the exocyclic nitrogen, which is the same in both cases (17 and 22).
However, the attachment of a smaller alkyl substituent in the 4-position of Aminorex (17) while retaining the phenyl ring is well tolerated, and so the inventors mentioned an effect comparable to that of Aminorex (17) for substances 23-25 (and other alkyl radicals).



In a subsequent patent from 1966, the inventors mentioned that CNS stimulation can be achieved with a lower dose of 23 (Methylaminorex, 1mg / kg; i.v.) in a previously anesthetized test animal, which was noticeable through increased locomotion [37]. In non-anesthetized animals, the effects were expressed, among other things, by restlessness and turning movements.
In rats, 4-methylaminorex (23, ED50 = 8.8mg / kg) reduced food intake with only a slightly weaker potency than Aminorex (17, ED50 = 5.8mg / kg) [6].
4-Methylaminorex (23) appeared on the black market as early as the late 1980s as “U4Euh” (pronounced Euphoria) or 4-MAX [33]. This was followed by the addition of 4-methylaminorex (23) to the list of narcotics in many countries.
