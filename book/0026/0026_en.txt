    Elimination and decarboxylation reactions then form Î±-keto-phenylacetic acids (11 and 13), which are converted into the respective amino acids L-tyrosine (12a) and L-phenylalanine (14a) via aminotransferases in the plant. Ultimately
the phenethylamine can now be formed by decarboxylation of 14a (15; see also Chapter 1). The chorismic acid (9) can also react with glutamic acid to form anthranilic acid, which in turn can be converted into tryptophan in several steps (not shown in the scheme). All atoms drawn in gray have their origin in erythrose-4-phosphate (3), the black atoms come from phosphoenolpyruvate (2).


    With this we establish that all aromatic alkaloids and every molecule of serotonin or dopamine (29), all of which contain a phenyl or an indole ring, have their origin in shikimic acid (1)!
    The number of pure phenethylamines is relatively small compared to heterocyclic derivatives with an arylethylamine basic structure. This is presumably because most naturally occurring substituents on the arene are HO groups, making the arene electron rich and favoring ring closure after the amines have reacted with a carbonyl compound (aldehydes or ketones). Thus, most phenethylamines, if they are electron-rich in nature, react further in the plant to form isoquinoline derivatives.

Prominent and lesser known naturally
occurring phenethylamines

    The naturally occurring phenethylamines are briefly portrayed below, following the degree of aryl substitution. In addition, an overview of the isoquinoline and indole derivatives provides an insight into the (incomplete) classifications. Literature references were largely dispensed with where the information relates to the Chapter in this book. It can therefore be found in detail in the chapters to which reference is made at the relevant points.
