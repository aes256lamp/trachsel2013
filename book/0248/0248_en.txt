1-Benzylpiperazine (73) was originally patented together with other derivatives in the 1960s (e.g. [114, 115]). Above all, the excellent properties in contrast to amphetamine and the few side effects were mentioned; In addition, the substances should be suitable for the treatment of depression. 1- (2-Thienyl) -methylpiperazine (86; 2-THMP) was also mentioned and carries the thiophene group bioisosteric to the phenyl ring.



In 1973 Bye et al. presented the parallel effects of 1-benzylpiperazine (73) on humans compared to amphetamine [116] and Segal et al. demonstrated the pronounced properties of 1-benzylpiperazine (73) as a locomotor stimulant (summarized in [113]) .
Baumann et al. investigated the molecular mechanisms of 1-benzylpiperazine due to the increasing abuse (73) [113]. It appears to have substrate activity on the dopamine transporter. In vzfro it was only able to release dopamine, but not serotonin. Nevertheless, 1-benzylpiperazine (73) stimulated a parallel increase in extracellular dopamine and serotonin in vivo, which is reminiscent of the effects of amphetamine and partially explains the locomotor stimulation. 1-Benzylpiperazine (73) showed only a weak affinity to Sigma receptors (Ki = 10480nM, [3H] DTG exchange) [99].

The combination of several arylalkylpiperazine derivatives seems to be popular [113]. Simultaneous intake of mTFMPP (85) and BZP (73) is said to mimic the psychotropic effects of the increasingly difficult to obtain 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA / Eecstasy; see chapter 7.5.6) to a limited extent. Baumann et al. clarified to what extent the effects at the molecular level can be compared with those of MDMA [113]. Simultaneous administration of mTFMPP (85) and BZP (73) to rats in a 1: 1 ratio reflected the effects of MDMA at 3 mg / kg; Serotonin and dopamine were increased in parallel in the brain dialysate (intracranial microdialysis). At the molecular biological level, this can at least partially explain why consumers are replacing MDMA with mTFMPP (85) and BZP (73).
The effect seems to be important at higher dosages. With a dose of 10 mg / kg of mTFMPP (85) and BZP (73) (1: 1 ratio), the dopamine concentration rose more than the sum of the individually administered substances would suggest [113]. As a result, dangerous positive synergies could arise at higher dosages.

The name “X4” refers to the questionable combination of four (!) Arylalkylpiperazinen, which are taken simultaneously [49]. Mention should be made of mTFMPP
