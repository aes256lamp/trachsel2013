The researchers also attached the amines mentioned to natural starch via a carbamate linker (29) [25]; here a section of 4 monomer units was drawn (for the sake of simplicity, only a section of the amylose, but not of the amylopectin, was drawn from the starch). The preparation was carried out by amide formation between the amines and the starch-chloroformate derivative prepared beforehand. Structure 30 shows amphetamine bound to starch; the amphetamine is arbitrarily drawn across the carbamate bridge to the starch. The publication did not mention the regularity and distribution of the amines actually bound to the starch [25]. The authors only gave the amine to starch ratios.



The starch-based polymers with amphetamine (various ratios of amphetamine to starch were prepared) were shown to be CNS stimulants and produced hyperactivity, increased salivation and hyperpnea, suggesting hydrolysis and release of the amphetamine in the body [25].
