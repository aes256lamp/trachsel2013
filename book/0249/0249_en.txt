95), mCPP (87), pCPP (88) and oMPP (89), but also pMPP (90) is mentioned.
    The unpredictable, strongly dose-dependent, mutual enhancement of the effects should be pointed out here again. In the future, a wide variety of piperazine derivatives and cocktails (see also Chapter 8.5.28, reference [49] or Medline) will be circulating on the narcotics market; it is therefore urgently necessary to create detailed knowledge about possible dangers. In addition to psychoactive effects, various phenylpiperazines showed an antimicrobial effect [117].



A variety of drugs exist that bear the structure 91-93. Many act as antihistamines or as antiemetics (relieving nausea and nausea). Their primary mode of action is partly by blocking the histamine H1 receptors. Some of these diphenylmethylpiperazines (structure 91) are also misused to a lesser extent to produce an altered state of consciousness [118]. However, very high doses are used and the effects experienced range from euphoric to dissociative (separation from the outside world). The therapeutic amount for commercial use is often 10-50mg, that for intoxication purposes> 400mg! A weak interaction with opioid receptors cannot be ruled out.
