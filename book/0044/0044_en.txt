Phenethylamine structures hidden in tetrahydroisoquinolines. As mentioned at the beginning, the number of compounds with a phenethylamine substructure, such as is found in the isoquinoline alkaloids, is much greater than that of the simple, non-rigidized phenethylamines. The diversity with which nature incorporates the phenethylamine base into heterocycles should only be briefly presented here. Only some of the basic structures are shown; there are further representatives for each basic structure [24].


a) The tryptamines are a separate class; cs is only intended to show that phenechylamine can also be found hidden in the indole nucleus - even if indole is physically and chemically completely different from phenethylamine
