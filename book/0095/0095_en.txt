Table 1. Relative potency of substances 1-5, measured against the dose required to be able to wake mice anesthetized with Dormin [31].


Table 2. Various symptoms observed and their frequency in humans under the influence of compounds 1-5. Numbers in percent, within a group [31].


The two compounds ethylamphetamine (3) and isopropylamphetamine (4) showed no organ symptoms (muscle tension, hand tremor, feeling of warmth and cold, sweating, headache and tachycardia) at the administered doses and the central effects (mood, well-being) were also much smaller here. The authors suspected the occurrence of very uncomfortable side effects when the dose was increased up to an amphetamine-like effect. In another experiment, where ten people each took 50 mg isopropylamphetamine (4), z. Sometimes very pronounced cold sweat, pale pale, palpitations, accelerated pulse and feeling cold. All persons had extensive experience with amphetamine (1) in therapeutic doses and stated that, despite the high dose of 4, its effect could not be compared with the intensity of amphetamine (1). In conclusion, the authors commented that none of the compounds investigated had a greater therapeutic value than amphetamine (1).

While many research groups focused on blood pressure, body temperature or anesthetic antagonism when examining such substances, others made use of the fact that amphetamine is locomotion (movement activity)
