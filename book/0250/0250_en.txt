1-(2-Phenethyl)piperazine (94) was patented in 2002 together with various piperazine derivatives as a "quality of life-improving substance" without, however, providing detailed pharmacological information [119].
Within the benzylpiperazines, many structural modifications are definitely conceivable (shown with the structures 95-97) which can lead to pharmacologically interesting compounds.
Substances 98-99 have the phenyl ring in the 2-position (R and / or R’- H, Me, Et, iPr etc.). They showed weak effects on the CNS [120]. 2-Phenylpiperazine showed weak analgesic effects (mice, rats and guinea pigs). The authors excluded further investigation of the compounds because of the weak effects.



3.12.4.3. Morpholines

Probably the best-known arylalkylmorpholines are the two compounds phenmetrazine (100) and phendimetrazine (101). Phendimetrazine (101) was marketed under names such as Anoran®, Antapentan®, Obex®, Obex LA®, Plegine® etc. for the short-term treatment of obesity and is now only prescribed in a few countries (e.g. under the name Bontril® ). Phenmetrazine (100) was previously sold as Oxazimedrin® Cafilon® and Preludin® (Fig. 7). Due to their abuse as a doping agent and psychostimulant, both substances have been included in the list of doping and/or narcotic drugs in many places.
