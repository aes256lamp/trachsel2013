In 1938 Jacobsen et al. the relative waking effect of ephedrine (1a) to amphetamine in mice. This was only 0.05 to 0.1 [3]. In 1962 Van der Schoot et al. Showed that ephedrine (1a) could only increase motor activity in mice (i.p.) by 8% relative to amphetamine [4].

The phenylpropanolamines have various mechanisms of action, on the one hand a direct agonistic activity on the adrenergic receptors. On the other hand, there are “indirect” effects, whereby the norepinephrine (NE) released via the transporter stimulates the adrenergic receptors (summarized in [5] and [6]). However, the research by Rothman et al. led to the assumption that ephedrine-like substances develop their effect primarily through substrate activity on NE transporters [6]. These compounds exhibited much deeper, if not negligible, affinities for the α and β adrenergic receptors. This suggests that such compounds exert their pharmacological effects primarily through the release of NE. These connections appear to be weak or inactive on the serotonin transporter [6].

The pseudoephedtines are understood to be the diastereomers 1c and 1d of the two enantiomers 1a and 1b [1]. The [1S, 2S] - (+) - form 1c is naturally present, while the [1R, 2R] - (-) - form 1d is obtained synthetically. [1S, 2S] - (+) - Pseudoephedrine (1c) is contained in numerous nasal decongestants (Fig. 2). It is also used for the (illegal) synthesis of S-methamphetamine; the enantiomer 1d would result in the almost ineffective R-methamphetamine (see also Chapter 3.1.1.1).

The removal of the N-methyl group of the four ephedrine stereoisomers leads to the four stereoisomeric norephedrines 2a-d (the prefix Nor probably comes from German and stands, among other things, for N without a remainder). The [1R, 2S] - (-) - form 2a is called (-) - norephedrine, the [1S, 2R] - (+) - form 2b (+) - norephedtine, the [1S, 2S] - (+) Form 2c is referred to as (+) - cathine or (+) - pseudonorephedrine and the [1R, 2R] - (-) - form 2d as (-) - cathine or (-) - pseudonorephedrine.
