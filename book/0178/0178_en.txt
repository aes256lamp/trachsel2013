careful monitoring of the drug users, as the manufacturer warns of an increased risk of suicidal ideation [14].
    Substances 13-15 (sertraline, paroxetine and escitalopram) are a few more examples of well-known and in some cases highly selective SSRIs. Recently, less selective inhibitors of the monoamine transporters have proven to be more effective antidepressants (see excursus on antidepressants).



Summary

    With regard to the hypertensive effect, 2-phenethylamine (4) turned out to be the most effective arylalkylamine. The distance of two carbon atoms - from the phenyl ring to the amine - is also central to other properties. The aromatic amino acids, from which important messenger substances such as epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine (see chapter 7.5) are derived, have this C2 distance. It is therefore hardly surprising that entactogens (see Chapter 7.5.6) and most psychedelic compounds (see Chapters 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6) follow this pattern. While shorter phenylalkylamines generally produced compounds of less pharmacological interest, chain lengthening (3-phenylpropylamines) leads to inhibitors of the monoamine transporters. This chain extension is used in many antidepressants, such. B. found in fluoxetine (9) and duloxetine (11).
