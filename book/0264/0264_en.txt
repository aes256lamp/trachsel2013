In a study from 1973 the question was investigated to what extent the simple structure of 2-AT (20) can mimic parts of the LSD structure 28] (see Chapters 7.3.3.2 and 8.5.27.1).
2-AT (20) showed around 50 times more inhibitory properties on the enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) than amphetamine [5]. PNMT catalyzes the transfer of an active methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to norepinephrine, from which epinephrine (adrenaline) is created (see also excursus natural products).

In order to investigate the conformational requirements for the inhibition of norepinephrine uptake, de Jong et al. 2-AT (20) with amphetamine, a-ethyl-phenethylamine (α-EPEA, see Chapter 3.6) and 2-amino-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (2-ADN, 25) [29]. Amphetamine was a potent inhibitor (see Chapter 2.3.2), and the α-ethylphenethylamine, which had been extended by one carbon atom, turned out to be significantly less active in its inhibitory potency. The two compounds 2-AT (20) and 2-ADN (25) showed an inhibition of norepinephrine uptake almost identical to that of amphetamine [29].

In mice, 2-ADN (25) stimulated locomotion by three quarters less potent than (+) - amphetamine [26]. The separation of the enantiomers of 2-ADN (25) revealed that only the (-) - S isomer is responsible for the effect of the racemate. A later study confirmed the results obtained with a discrimination study in mice [24]. In this test, 2-ADN (25) was one quarter and 2-AT (20) one eighth as potent as (+) - amphetamine.

Glennon et al. synthesized and investigated a number of N-alkylated phenylalkylamines (see Chapter 3.1.1.2) in order to obtain ligands with the highest possible affinity for the sigma receptor [30]. Rigid, benzene-fused derivatives (26-29), which turned out to be potent sigma ligands, were also investigated. Compound 28 had a Ki = 7.90nM. Modifications to the aromatic did not change the affinities, but the length of the “linker”, the carbon chain from the nitrogen to the phenyl ring, is decisive.
