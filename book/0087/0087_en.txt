Fig. 3. Methamphetamine (here brand names Norodin or Amphedroxyn) was advertised intensively as an antidepressant or for the treatment of alcohol dependence and narcolepsy [54].


Pharmacology and Subjective Effects [1]

Peripheral effects: However, it should be noted that the type of effect depends on the composition of the two stereoisomers. The physical effects are mainly due to the (-) - R isomer, which acts more strongly than its stereoisomer as an indirect agonist on the adrenergic α1, ß1 and ß2 receptors. The pupils are dilated, the heart rate and blood pressure increase and the muscles are supplied with more energy through an increased glucose level. The direct agonistically mediated sympathomimetic effects are indirectly increased by the increased amount of norepinephrine released. Central effects are mainly caused by the (+) - S isomer.

Key effects: The pharmacology of methamphetamine (2) is complex. Only the most important things are dealt with here, although there is a lot of literature on this topic (see summary [1]). Methamphetamine (2) has no noteworthy affinities for serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) or adrenergic receptors, but for monoamine transporters. It is a symphatomimetic that is effective both peripherally and in the central nervous system. As with amphetamine, an increased release of NE from the noradrenergic neurons seems to be responsible for wakefulness and the anorectic effects, while an increased release of DA from the dopaminergic neurons
