3.6. α-substituted phenylalkylamines

    The smallest possible extension of the amphetamine side chain leads to 1-phenyl-2-aminobutane (1; AEPEA). As early as 1962, Van der Schoot et al. Showed that this extension to α-ethylphenethylamine resulted in a drastic decrease in activity [1]: The locomototic activity of mice was increased by only 16% relative to amphetamine when administered i.p. Oberlender and Nichols showed in a drug discrimination study with rats that the S - (+) - enantiomer of AEPEA (1) could only partially substitute for S - (+) - amphetamine even at the highest tested doses [2] which is a further indication of the significant decrease in effectiveness.
    The introduction of even larger residues in the α-position (compounds 1-4) was also associated with a loss of effectiveness with regard to motor activity [1].
    Paulsen-Sörman et al. showed the stereoselectivity in the metabolic formation of intermediate complexes (cytochrome P-450) by means of the enantiomerically pure forms of 1-3 [3].

    The influence of 1-ethynylphenethylamine (5) on motor activity in mice and on blood pressure in cats was tested in 1966 [4]. Primarily, 5 showed a decrease in motor activity. 2-Phenethylamine itself usually shows almost no CNS stimulation (see Chapter 1). However, if a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is administered in advance, 2-phenethylamine proves to be a clear CNS stimulant in the test animal. If compound 5 was now administered to mice (i.p.) and the test animals were treated with 2-phenethylamine 2-4 hours later, a clear CNS stimulation (increase in motor activity) could be determined. From this the authors concluded that 5 acts as a MAO inhibitor.
