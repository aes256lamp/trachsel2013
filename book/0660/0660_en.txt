Fig. 4. A: Rigidisation of two MeO groups of TMA-3 (8) to the dioxol moiety leads to a moderately potent psychoactive compound only in the case of MMDA-3a (12). B: In the case of the positional isomer TMA (17), rigidisation of two MeO groups results in maintenance of effect (MMDA, 32). C: The active dose of 2T-MMDA-3a (14), a fusion of the structures 12 and 5, is yet to be known.
