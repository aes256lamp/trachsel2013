More recent structural investigations restrict the degrees of freedom with new concepts, and so azacyclic and spiro compounds (57-61) were produced and the affinities for the [3H] ketanserin-labeled 5-HT2A receptor were tested [11]. SPAMDA (87, Ki = 4nM) had the highest affinity. With the compounds 61 and 62 it could be shown that two aromatic systems are essential for the affinity. The derivatives 63-66 are further compounds which have structural similarities to AMDA (1). Asenapine (63) is a new, atypical antipsychotic approved as SaphrisÂ®, which shows remarkably high affinities (in the single-digit or subnanomolar range) and has an antagonistic effect on numerous subtypes of the serotonergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic and histaminergic receptors [17]. Compounds 64 and analogues thereof belong to the azecine class of compounds and were developed by Witt, Hock and Lehmann [18]. The tetracyclic 65 serves as a synthetic precursor for 64. Since these precursors have no affinities for serotonin receptors, it can be assumed that the distance between the aromatics and the nitrogen is too small. Type 64 azecins have high affinities for the dopamine D1 receptor and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Surprisingly, the modifications to the molecule affect the affinities for both of these receptors to the same extent [19]. Type 66 compounds (X: O, S, NH and CH2) were patented in 1990 [20]. The inventors write of "very potent antidopamine and anti-5HT2 activities, which render them extremely suitable for use as antipsychotic compound ..." a).
