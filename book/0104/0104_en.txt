Summary

The most prominent connection in this chapter is undoubtedly methamphetamine (2) with its long and eventful past as a stimulant and anorectic. Although severely restricted because of its significant addiction potential, it is still used as a drug (treatment for ADHD and as an anorectic). Thanks to its easy synthetic accessibility, methamphetamine as a drug (“meth”) is still massively produced in illegal underground laboratories and abused worldwide. A number of drugs could be viewed as "inspired" by methamphetamine (2) - always with the hope of optimizing pharmacological properties. Methamphetamine (2) itself has no significant affinities at the monoamine receptors. Its central effects as a releaser of monoamines (primarily NE and DA) are mainly attributed to the S-enantiomer, while the R-enantiomer is mainly responsible for the peripheral effects.
Compounds with longer aliphatic residues on nitrogen lose their effect as monoamine releasers, but some are patented as reuptake inhibitors. If phenethylamine (5) or amphetamine (1) carries an additional alkaryl unit on the nitrogen, the affinity for the σ-receptor increases. Both effects (reuptake inhibition of monoamines and sigma agonism) could be helpful in the treatment of depression. In contrast to their α-alkylated derivatives, phenethylamines become very quickly in the body
