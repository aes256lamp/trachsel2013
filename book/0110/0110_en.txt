is metabolized, which can be explained by the regioselectivity of the enzymes involved. In summary: By demonstrating the enantiomers, it cannot always be clearly stated whether the drug was taken as a conventional drug or an illegal substance.
Selegiline (16) is used to treat Parkinson's disease. This occurs with a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (in the substanceia nigra), which means a depletion of dopamine in the striatum. The therapy is to prevent the breakdown of existing dopamine caused by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Selegiline is used either as a single therapy or in combination with L-DOPA. By increasing the dopamine concentration as a whole, clear alleviations of the symptoms are achieved.

The two substances methylbiamphetamine (di (ß-phenylisopropyl) methylamine; M-DPIA; 18) and triamphetamine (tri (ß-phenylisopropyl) amine; TPIA; 19) were found as contamination products in illegal amphetamine samples [13].

Studies with tired volunteers were carried out with Prolintan (20) as early as 1970 and the effects compared with (+) - S-amphetamine [14]. Structurally related to the DAT inhibitor pyrovalerone (see Chapter 6.3.6), its physical and mental effects were examined in healthy volunteers in the mid-1980s [15]. At the administered doses (10-20 mg) it showed little cardiovascular effects. Some increase was observed in the volunteers in tests of mental performance. It acts as a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and was used under the name Katovit® to treat chronic fatigue or lethargy. In 2002, Prolintan (20), available in Spain and Germany and sold as Katovit®, appeared at rave parties for recreational use [16].
