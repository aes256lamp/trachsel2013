8. trisubstituted phenylalkylamines

However, depending on the 4-substituent, the corresponding derivatives of the 3,4,5-series may well be equally potent or even more potent (see Chapter 8.4.11). The derivatives of the 2,4,5-series also appear to have a marked affinity for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor; however, more substances of both series with identical 4-substituents would have to be measured for a direct comparison to be able to make conclusive statements. In binding studies with antagonistic radioligands (ketanserin and mesulergin), of the substances measured so far, even the 3,4,5-substituted phenethylamines that are most potent in humans show only relatively low affinities.
An important difference is also the influence of an \alpha-Me group: In the 3,4,5-series, this causes only a weak increase in in-vivo potency (Chapter 8.4.10). This is in stark contrast to the 2,4,5 series, where the presence of an \alpha-Me group makes a substance up to a factor of 10 more potent in humans (Chapter 8.5.15). Unfortunately, there are currently too few in-vitro data on the 3,4,5-series to be able to explain the differences observed in humans between the two classes.

# Interstructural commonalities

The 3,4,5-, 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-series have some things in common: The 4-substituent can assume the largest steric expansion and significantly determines in-vitro data (e.g. affinities, functional potency and functional selectivity, metabolism) as well as the nature of perceptual and consciousness changes in humans. Small, lipophilic substituents lead to potent 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor agonists, large, lipophilic ones to antagonists. The 4-substituent interacts with a hydrophobic region of the receptor. Its variation decisively alters the character of action.
Another common feature of these three classes is the arrangement of the two remaining substituents on the aromatic: One MeO group each is arranged perpendicular to the 1,4-axis (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3: Similarities between the 3,4,5-, 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-series: All have a MeO group on one side of the 1,4-axis, and each of the series has the 4-substituent, which is crucial for a high affinity to the 5-HT2A receptor as well as for the psychedelic character of action.
