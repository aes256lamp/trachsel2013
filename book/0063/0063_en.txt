These values obtained from in vitro and in vivo reflect the general effect in humans: While (+) - S-amphetamine (1a) is able to produce the above-described physiological and psychological effects very effectively, (-) - R -Amphetamine (1b) the effects were observed to be much less pronounced. In other assays the two are equally effective, i.e. equipotent: inhibition of norepinephrine uptake into the presynapse and as a circulatory stimulant,

As noted, the effects of psychoactive substances are complex. They depend on various factors and are difficult to parameterize, such as by specifying IC50, values, changes in blood pressure, etc. If one wanted to record the actual differences between two stereoisomers, one would have to take into account all the receptors, transporters and enzymes involved examine the individual genotype. The effect as such is an interplay of these systems.
