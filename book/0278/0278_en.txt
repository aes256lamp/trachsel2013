Initially, the investigations on AMDA () focused on the interaction with the 5-HT2A receptor. By antagonizing the 5-HT2A receptor, it is hoped that new approaches will be found to treat sleep disorders [8]. Only later did the focus shift to the histamine H1 interaction, because ligands of the histamine H1 receptor also represent a very promising treatment method for sleep disorders [9, 10].
It is structurally recognizable why the early generations of antiallergic drugs such as cyproheptadine (19) or diphenhydramine (20) have a sedative effect on the patient as a side effect, and why certain active ingredients can also be used as sleeping aids in addition to the antiallergic effect. The analysis of the structure-activity relationship of AMDA (1) provides the basis for the development of more selective active ingredients so that the desired effect can be achieved in a more targeted manner.



Despite, or perhaps precisely because of, the sparse pharmacophoric groups (two aromatic rings and amino group) and the similarities to imipramine (18) and cyproheptadine (19), AMDA (1) is relatively selective - at least on the tested targets - and, in contrast to 18 and 19 no affinity for the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, at least in the competitive assay (Table 1) [1].

This led to the assumption that e.g. imipramine (18) has a different binding mode than AMDA (!) [12]. Cyproheptadine (19), originally developed as an antidepressant, is a histamine / serotonin H1 / 5-HT2 antagonist and is now mainly used against allergic reactions, but is also used as an appetite stimulant
