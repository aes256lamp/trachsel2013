A number of compounds that have a keto function instead of beta alcohol (bk compounds or cathinones) have also been investigated. In particular, obscure online shops have recently sold various aryl-substituted cathinones (e.g. F, Me, CF3), including the side chain and N-substituent variations, as so-called legal highs [35-38]. The simplest analog is the oxidized form of norephedrine (cathine) and is called cathinone (12). The S - (-) - enantiomer 12a occurs naturally together with (1S, 2S) -cathin (2c) in the Kath shrub Carha edulis, which is native to Ethiopia, Kenya and Arabia [8]. Its leaves were and are still chewed as a stimulant, but ritual uses are also widespread (history and uses are described in detail in Ref. [8]). The studies by Van der Schoot et al. showed that cathinone (12; stereochemistry was not noted) is able to increase locomotor activity in mice relative to amphetamine by 51% [4]. It was only discovered in 1981 that cathinone, the actual ingredient, is responsible for the stimulating effect of the plant [8]. However, primary amino ketones readily dimerize by themselves oxidatively under basic conditions to form diphenylpyrazines, such as 14 (Fig. 3) [9].

The methyl analog of cathinone (12) is called methcathinone (13; = oxidized form of ephedrine). As far as we know today, methcathinone (13a) is a purely synthetic product that is produced in a simple manner from the natural substance ephedrine (1a). Interestingly, methcathinone (13a) appeared as an intoxicant in the former Soviet Union and was first identified in Leningrad in 1982. There the term ephedron was used. In the late 1980s the boom began in the United States of America; there
