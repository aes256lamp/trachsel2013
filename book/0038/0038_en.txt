was used, the traffic of safrole-containing sassafras oil and safrol (71) is subject to official controls in many places.
It is therefore still not clear which substance is responsible for the psychoactive effects of nutmeg. Rather, the phenylpropane derivatives themselves or any terpenes they may contain seem to be responsible for the effect
[29]. Strong taste, frequent side effects and from 5-7g nutmeg also more serious symptoms of poisoning make the consumption unpopular. A carcinogenic effect of safrole (71) is also discussed. Use in the perfume industry or in food has been banned.

Phenethylamines from the sea: a treasure chest

Sponges (Porifera) belong to the animal tribe of the tissue-less (Parazoa) and live almost exclusively in marine environments. They can incorporate bromide ions contained in seawater into organic molecules such as tyrosine (12a). Anomoian A (95, see chapter 8.4.11) isolated from the Verongid sponge Anomoianthella popeae has fungicidal and antimicrobial effects. The sponge Tanthella basta, which is native to the South Pacific, contains various Bastadin derivatives, such as Bastadin-5 (96, see Chapter 8.4.11). Psammaplysin A (97) also has an antimicrobial effect; it comes from the sponge Psammaplysilla purpurea (see Chapter 8.4.11).



Another interesting class of alkaloids are the leucettamines, which have been isolated from the sponge Lemerta mieroraphis [30, 31]. These alkaloids carry methyl
