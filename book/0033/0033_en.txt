other mental illnesses (see also “Popular Catalysis” in chapter 8.4.1.4). It is unclear whether it can be classified as a psychotropic substance at all, as for example in the film Far and Loathing in Las Vegas.

Macromerin (46, see chapter 7.5.4.1). This natural substance was found in various cacti (Coryphantha macromeris, C. v. Runyonii, C. elephantidens) detected. Its psychoactive effects are controversial.

Mesembrine (47) and Joubertiamine (48) are found in the midday flowers (genus: Mesembryanthemum). The plants have been used as Kanna, Channa or Kougoed in South Africa since prehistoric times, and were first mentioned in writing by Dutch explorers over two hundred years ago [15]. The phytonutrients are believed to have anti-anxiety and hunger-suppressing properties. Nine different alkaloids have been identified [16].
Mesembrine (47) has a mood-enhancing, calming effect and could be responsible for the antidepressant effects. Its use and that of the dried plant components were patented in 2001 as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor [17]. Joubertiamine (48) is a phenylpropylamine, but has certain similarities to NMDA antagonists such as ketamine and phencyclidine (see Section 3.12.4.1). Because of its enone structure, it is chiral. So far, no pharmacological studies have been described.

Mescaline derivatives (see Section 8.4.1).
Mescaline (49) occurs mainly in the peyote cactus (Lopbophora williamsi), but also in some other cacti. The natural range of the cacti is roughly in northern Mexico and southern Texas. Discs of the cactus, which were found in the caves as burial attachments and dated to several thousand years, indicate a long history and symbiosis with humans. This suggests that the Indians living there used this “magic cactus” ritually even then. Various cacti later became other, non-psychedelic mescaline relatives such as N-methylmescaline (50) and N, N-dimethylmescaline (51) as well
