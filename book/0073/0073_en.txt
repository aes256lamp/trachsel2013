Alkyl substituents on the side chain (α and β positions, Chapters 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9)

If the side chain is lengthened, there is a significant loss of effectiveness. Compared to amphetamine (3), AEPEA (28) shows only weak stimulating properties in various animal studies (Chapter 3.6). Under certain circumstances, however, a considerable stimulating effect can still be achieved with longer side chains, e.g. with the substance Prolintan (29).
Lefetamine (30) has a phenyl residue in the α-position to nitrogen and, in addition to stimulatory properties, also has analgesic properties. It binds to opioid receptors and was found to be a moderate NMDA antagonist.



Probably the most prominent α, α-disubstituted phenylalkylamine is phentermine (31; Chapter 3.7). It was approved as a treatment for obesity back in the late 1950s. However, it later came under fire, especially in combination with fenfluramine (32) (combination known as Fen / Phen), as its simultaneous use could clearly be associated with a heart valve change and pulmonary hypertension. However, later studies clearly indicated that these strong side effects are attributable to fenfluramine (32), and so phentermine (31) is still sold on the pharmaceutical market, albeit to a limited extent. In higher doses it can have a stimulating effect.
In animal studies, the N-methyl analog mephentermine (33) showed a somewhat less pronounced stimulation than phentermine (31) and was recognized as a means for pronounced increases in blood pressure. That was also the first indication.
