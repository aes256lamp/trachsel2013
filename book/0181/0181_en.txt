Depression - a widespread disease

Depression is one of the most common diseases [1-3]. The risk of developing depression during a lifetime is between 10 and 25% for women, depending on the source, and between 5 and 12% for men [2]. With these estimates, annual costs in the US alone are on the order of $100 billion. While the economic damage can be quantified, the suffering of those affected cannot be put into numbers [2].
 The group of patients with severe depression has a suicide rate of 5-10%, much more than any other mental disorder. For patients with severe schizophrenic disorder, a suicide rate of 2% is reported. Depression has far-reaching psychological and physical consequences. A kind of questionnaire called the Hamilton depression scale is used to determine the severity of depression. Symptoms are manifested as decreased interest in activity and joylessness. In addition to being depressed and upset, there are often tiredness, loss of energy and feelings of worthlessness. Anxiety and thoughts of death and suicide are typical of this disease. The physical effects, to name a few, range from headaches, neck and lower back pain to heart ailments and indigestion.
