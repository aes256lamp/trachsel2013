in methylphenidate (52) with an oxygen (structure 56) or even with a carbon atom (structure 57) leads to compounds that still bind to the dopamine transporter (DAT). The 3,4-dichloro substitution on the aromatic leads to an increase in affinity for the DAT within these nitrogen-free substances, just as in the case of the nitrogen-containing analogues, and thus to potent and selective DAT inhibitors.

Facetoperan (58; also called Lidepran) carries an inversion of the ester of methylphenidate (52). Ester inversion is a frequently used strategy in medicinal chemistry. This makes it possible to obtain compounds with a similar action profile and at the same time to change one or the other pharmacodynamic parameter. Facetoperan (58) was investigated in the 1960s, among other things, as a treatment for obesity [76], and has been considered for the treatment of depression [77]. A psychostimulating effect was also mentioned [77]. Van der Schoot et al. showed a relative potency of 8% to amphetamine with regard to locomotor stimulation (mice; i.p.) [58].



Deoxypipradrol resp. 2- (Diphenylmethyl) piperidine (59; 2-DPMP) has a second phenyl ring. It was published in 1954 by the Ciba company [78] and patented [79]. In prepared synaptic vesicles of the rat brain, both stereoisomers of deoxypipradrol (59) were able to inhibit the uptake of tritiated dopamine and norepinephrine in an approximately equipotent manner [80]. In non-anesthetized mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, it produced a strong increase in locomotion at 1 mg / kg. In mice, the potency of (+) - S-methamphetamine was equated and compared to amphetamine, deoxypipradrol (59) was about three times as potent. Deoxypipradrol (59) was able to antagonize various narcotics and showed almost no peripheral sympathomimetic effects. Bellucci showed that at 1 mg / kg in rabbits there was slight hypertension, and at 3-6 mg / kg it was more likely to lower the blood pressure [81]. In patients, 59 also lowered blood pressure, but significantly increased mental alertness [82]. Dosages of 3mg (per patient) caused headaches, nausea or palpitation (palpitations) in some patients.

Various derivatives of the Type 60 were later manufactured and patented. For example, N-alkyl derivatives (R = H; R '= alkyl) or those which have a further substituent in the benzyl position (R = alkyl; R' = H or alkyl) have proven to be particularly active [83 84] . Compounds were also mentioned in which one or even both phenyl rings were replaced by a 2-thienyl group [85].
