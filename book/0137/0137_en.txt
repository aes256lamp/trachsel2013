Compound 20 is known under the name α-pyrrolidinopentiophenone or α-PVP and was patented in the 1960s [11]. Many years later, along with other phenyl-substituted derivatives, Meltzer et al. examined for interaction with neurotransmitter reuptake with the aim of finding a means of combating cocaine abuse, i.e. a means that will facilitate the exit from addiction [12]. Structurally, α-PVP (20) is closely related to pyrovalerone (21; see Section 6.3.6) and Prolintan (22; safe, Section 3.2.1). Competitive measurements ([125] RTI 55) showed that 20 did not interact with the SERT (Ki> 10uM), but moderately with the NET (Ki = 200nM) and strongly with the DAT (Ki = 34nM) [12]. Cocaine was used to compare the affinities (NET Ki = 2150nM and DAT Ki = 430nM). These substances proved to be primarily reuptake inhibitors and not releasers. As shown by the methylenedioxy analogue MDPV (23, see also Chapter 7.5.7.3 and Chapter 6.3.6 for other cathinones), there are indications that such compounds have a similar abuse potential as cocaine itself [12, 39].

The derivative diethylpropion (diethylcathinone; 24) had in the Van der Schoot et al. in 1962, extensive locomotion studies presented a relative potency of 68% compared to amphetamine on (i.p., mice) [4]. It bears names on the market such as Amphepramone®, Anorex®, Linea®, Nobesine®, Prefamone®, Regenon®, Tenuate®, and Tepanil® and is used in a few countries for the short-term treatment of obesity (Fig. 4). It is assumed that diethylpropione (24) has a low potential for abuse. However, diethylpropion (24) is suspected of causing pulmonary arterial hypertension (pulmonary hypertension, PAH) [13] and having a neurotoxic effect [14]. There is evidence that diethylpropion (24) is a prodrug of ethcathinone (14) [34]. Diethylpropion (24) showed no affinities for the monoamine transporters, whereas the metabolite ethcathinone (14) turned out to be a selective substrate of the norepinephrine transporter [34].
