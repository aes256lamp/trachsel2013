8. Trisubstituted Phenylalkylamines

The trisubstituted phenylalkylamines can be classified by a total of six different position isomers. Fig. 1 shows their fundamental structures starting from 2-phenethylamine. The approximate number of compounds discussed in the chapters reflects the relevance of these structures in research. About 600 compounds with a trisubstitution have been collected and described.
