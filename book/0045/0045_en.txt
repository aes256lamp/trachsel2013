An abundance of alkaloids has also been described which have incorporated an indolylalkylamine backbone in some way [51]. Whether the entire indole part corresponds to the phenyl radical is a question that arises from bioiosteric explanations
required and cannot be discussed here.
Nevertheless, a small insight into the variety of basic structures with tryptamine units should be given, without going into their properties. Reference is made to further literature [48, 51].
