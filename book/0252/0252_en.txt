The drug form of phendimetrazine is a racemic mixture of the transoid stereoisomers. Phendimetrazine (101) was essentially inactive on the DA, NE and 5-HT transporters [30]. In contrast, the N-desmethyl derivative phenmetrazine (100) proved to be a potent substrate for DAT and NET and was able to release DA and NE. Serotonin could be released around 100 times less and therefore only insignificantly. Since NE was released around five times more than DA, it is assumed that phendimetrazine (101) resp. The metabolite phenmetrazine (100) primarily produces its effects through the release of NE (see also the noradrenergic hypothesis in Section 2.3.2).
The two transoid 100a and 100b proved to be more potent than the cisoid stereoisomers 100c and 100d (around 10 times more potent for the release of NE). Interestingly, the cisoid stereoisomers showed a different (weak) interaction with the DA transporter: 100c is a reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and 100d is a releaser of dopamine [30].



Since phendimetrazine (101) is / was used as an anorectic, the question inevitably arises whether, like other anorectics (see Aminorex (17) in Chapter 3.12.3.), It can lead to pulmonary hypertension or heart disease. So far there is no concrete indication of this. The general patient information at least indicates that it should not be used in the case of increased blood pressure and that cardiac arrhythmias can occur. If one compares the molecular mechanisms of anorectics that have been associated with pulmonary hypertension, they do not directly reveal a possible danger. The problematic anorectics are all potent substrates of the serotonin transporter, and phendimetrazine (101) resp. Phenmetrazine (100) showed almost no activity on this transporter.

Interestingly, aryl-substituted analogues of phenmetrazine (100) appeared to be largely unknown until now; It was not until 2011 that a patent was published (by Rothman among others) which - taking into account the stereochemistry - describes numerous aryl-substituted phendimetrazine analogs (102) and positional isomers (103-104) and their interaction with the monoamine transporters [137]. The aim of the invention is the modulation of the monoamine levels with the help of the new substances and thus the treatment of diseases such as obesity, depression or addiction. Since the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor is a so-called antitarget (see excursus anorectics), the activities on this receptor were also determined in each case. Similar compounds, e.g. B. 105 [138] or G 130 (106) [139], anorectic and stimulating properties were ascribed decades earlier. It would be exciting to see the oxygen-free analogous connections likewise on the interaction with the monoaminergic neurotransmission
