3.1. N-alkyl substituted phenylalkylamines



3.1.1. Phenylisopropylamine (amphetamines)


After the discovery of the diverse spectrum of activity of amphetamine (Chapter 2), its molecular structure served as the starting point for a remarkable number of new compounds. The search for new substances was driven by the goal of either enhancing or suppressing specific properties of amphetamines. The simplest and most obvious modification is the derivatization of the basic nitrogen in amphetamine (1).


3.1.1.1. Methamphetamine

Methamphetamine (2) is certainly one of the more interesting phenylalkylamines, not least thanks to its simple molecular structure, which has potent peripheral and central effects. It was first made over a hundred years ago, and it quickly became very popular thanks to World War II. Although its epidemic spread was combated, it is still topical and on everyone's lips today. The focus of the following chapter is on the one hand on the pharmacological properties and on the other hand on the socio-political relevance.

Methamphetamine (methyl-alphamethylphenethylamine) is an amphetamine derivative that has a methyl group on the nitrogen. In chemical nomenclature it is also known as N, α-dimethylphenethylamine, phenylisopropylmethylamine or deoxyephedrine and has a few other systematic names [1]: The free base of methamphetamine (pKa = 9.9) is liquid at room temperature, has a fishy odor and tastes bitter . The hydrochloride salt evaporates at 300-305 ° C without pyrolysis. It can therefore be smoked directly and does not have to be released as a base, as is the case with cocaine, for example.
Methamphetamine (2) can exist in two stereoisomers. A distinction is made between the more active (+) - S-methamphetamine (2a) and its mirror image (-) - R-methamphetamine (2b), which has more pronounced peripheral effects. The two isomers sometimes have very different pharmacological properties [1].
