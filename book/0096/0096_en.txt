stimulates. This phenomenon can be observed particularly well in rats and mice [33]. A cage with light barriers, the interruption of which was recorded, was typically used for this purpose. The more the test animal moves in the cage, the more interruptions in the light beams are recorded. After a zero adjustment (without active substance, but administration of a physiological NaCl solution), in which the basic movement activity is measured, the locomotion is then measured under the influence of the administered substance. Such a measurement is shown qualitatively in the following Fig. 4. Nowadays, more modern measuring techniques than the light barrier technology are available (video camera and evaluation using a computer).

In 1962 van der Schoot et al. a number of structurally related amphetamine compounds on the influence of motor activity in mice according to the method described above [33]. Table 3 lists various N-substituted amphetamine derivatives (1-4 and 6-12) and their relative potency to amphetamine. Administration was i.p. As can be seen from this series of experiments, the strength of the action decreases continuously with increasing size of the substituent on the nitrogen. Only one methyl group (methamphetamine; 2) increases the effect.These observations on the increase in spontaneous locomotor activity agree with the studies on the awakening effect in mice and the development of symptoms in humans: If the substituent exceeds a critical size, the effects mentioned decrease .
