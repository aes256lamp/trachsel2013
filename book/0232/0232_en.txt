There are four possible stereoisomers of 4 methylaminorex (23a-d), with the (±) -cis derivative 23a and 23b normally in circulation [38]. Young and Glennon showed that the (±) -cis-4-methylaminorex (23a and b) in cocaine-trained rats (ED50 = 2.60mg / kg) with an ED50 = 1.1mg / kg is more potent than cocaine, but around six times less potent than rac. Aminorex (17; ED50 = 0.22 mg / kg) was [33]. Batsche et al. showed that 4-methylaminorex (23) stimulates the locomotion of test animals and generates stereotypical behavior [39].
Kankaanpää et al. examined the four stereoisomers for their acute neurochemical effects and presented how they affect the locomotion and stereotypical behavior of rats [38]. The authors concluded from their studies that the substances mainly act via the release of dopamine and, to a lesser extent, also serotonin. Except for 23c, all isomers increased the extracellular dopamine and serotonin concentrations (DA: 23d> 23a ≈ 23b> 23c; 5-HT: 23a> 23d ≈ 23b> 23c). Due to its serotonin-releasing effect, there is a risk of developing fatal pulmonary arterial hypertension when taking 4-methylaminorex (23). The first documented cases seem to confirm this hypothesis [40].



The substitution on the exocyclic nitrogen is also obvious, and so Poos et al. a number of such substances have also been investigated (structure 18, see previous pages) [6]. The anorectic effect is lost with the substitution of nitrogen (compounds 26 and 27). Only the dimethyl derivative 28 retained its hunger suppressant properties with an ED50 value of 7mg / kg.
The substitution on the endocyclic nitrogen also resulted in active compounds; at least the derivative 29 (3,4-dimethylaminorex or N-methyl-4-methylaminorex; 4S, 5S isomer) completely substituted for (+) - amphetamine (ED50 = 1.9μmol / kg; rats) [34] and was thus as potent as amphetamine itself. Just as Aminorex can be produced from 2-amino-1-phenylethanol and 4-methylaminorex from norephedrine in a simple one-step process,
