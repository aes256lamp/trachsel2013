bar certain structural requirements are met (compare similar structures of imipramine (18), cyproheptadine (19) and diphenhydramine 20). The elongation of the side chain, along with the N-alkylations, revealed a propyl linker as the optimal length between the tricyclic system and amine for both binding sites.
It is also interesting what influence the chain length has on the affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. In the case of the double benzylamine structure of 32 (Ki = 12000nM), the distance between the aromatic and the basic amine seems to be too small to enter into an interaction. As soon as there are 2 carbon atoms between the aromatic and nitrogen, one has the high affinities of AMDA (1, Ki = 20nM). If the distance in the case of 33 (Ki = 480nM) is expanded by one carbon atom to form a double propylamine structure, the affinities become
