it is referred to as a car, among other things. The connection was included in the Narcotics Act in many places.

    Rothman et al. investigated besides the phenylpropanolamines 1a-d and 2a-d also S - (-) - cathinone (12a) and S - (-) - methecathinone (13a) for the interaction with a wide range of receptors and transporters [6]. Compared to the SERT-inactive ephedrine-like substances, these two compounds showed only slightly increased substrate activity on the serotonin transporter. In contrast to the ephedrine-like substances, however, they showed values for the release of NE and DA that were comparable to those of amphetamine.
    Van der Schoot et al. showed in an extensive locomotion study on mice (i.p.) in 1962 that methcathinone (13) has a relative potency of 68% compared to amphetamine [4].
    His group also examined the cathinone analogues 14-18 [4]. In Table 1 it can be seen that the increased locomotion due to the respective oxo compounds 14-18 correlates well with that of oxygen-free compounds (N-alkyl-amphetamines). It can also be seen that the potency decreases continuously as the size of the nitrogen substituent increases; only one methyl group brings an increase.
    In a drug discrimination study with S-amphetamine trained rats (1 mg / kg; ED50 = 0.33 mg / kg), Dal Cason, Young and Glennon investigated the structure-activity relationship between the amphetamine and the cathinone basic structure in 1997 [10]. According to their research, methcathinone (13; ED50 = 0.37mg / kg) was about twice as potent as cathinone (12; ED50 = 0.7img / ke). Dimethylcathinone (19; ED50 = 0.61mg / kg) is in between and is unexpectedly potent when the amphetamines are used for comparison: SN,N-dimethylamphetamine (ED50 = 2.92mg / kg) is more than eight times less potent than S-amphetamine (ED50 = 0.33mg / kg). ED50 values were also determined for N-ethylcathinone (14; 0.771mg / kg) and N-propylcathinone (15; 2.03mg / kg).
