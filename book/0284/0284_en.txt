A bromo substituent (substance 50, Ki = 1.3nM) or even a large (3-phenyl radical (substance 51, Ki = 3.2nM) increase the affinity of AMDA (4, Ki = 20nM) for the 5-HT2A receptor again Here, however, a variation of the 4-substituent does not seem to have such a pronounced effect on the affinity as was observed with the 4-substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenylalkylamines (e.g. a 4-MeO or even 4-HO substituent reduces the affinity enormously, see Chapter 8.5.6 and Table 10 in Chapter 8.5.12) This is probably due to the fact that AMDA with its lipophilic basic structure already largely covers the antagonistic binding requirements.

From all the structural research, the authors concluded that there is a certain similarity between AMDA derivatives and phenylalkylamines and the tricyclic / polycyclic classes of 5-HT2 ligands, but that AMDA (1) and its derivatives bind differently to the 5-HT2A receptor [ 1]. It has been speculated that AMDA might bind similarly to the antagonistic phenylalkylamines (e.g. DOPP, 48) and that multiple modes of binding exist at these receptors. In the case of AMDA derivatives, there are practically only hydrophobic interactions with the receptors. The decisive factor is the distance between the aromatic and nitrogen, the distance between the two aromatic and the angularity, geometry and spread of the aromatic. As is generally known with phenylalkylamines [21], no higher serotonin 5-HT2A vs. 5-HT2C subtype selectivity could be achieved here either (see also Section 8.5.1) [1].
