Other users already reported clear effects with 2 mg 1 hour after ingestion, which, however, are not dissociative but rather antidepressant and mood-enhancing in nature. The “therapeutic dose range” is very narrow, and most experience reports describe a dissociative effect [49].
Phencyclidine (39) does not act selectively as an NMDA antagonist, but has an affinity for other targets that are also discussed with regard to antidepressant effects: It acts as a histamine H3 antagonist [50], as an antagonist at the neurokinin NK1 receptor [51] , as a sigma receptor agonist [52], as a dopamine D2 partial agonist [53] and as a serotonin 5-HT3 antagonist [54]. In addition, phencyclidine (39) inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norpinephrine [55].
