At the neuronal level, methylphenidate (52) binds stereoselectively and enantioselectively to the dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) transporters (eudysmic ratio 52b / 52a = 8.58 and 6.84, respectively) [68] and inhibits DA reuptake in vitro as well in vivo comparable to cocaine [70].
NE appears to play a potentially important role in the effects of methylphenidate (52); the extracellular NE concentrations are also increased by 52 [67]. The extracellular serotonin (5-HT) concentrations in the test animal could not be influenced even at very high doses (30 mg / kg) methylphenidate (52) [67], which is associated with a low affinity for the 5-HT transporter [71, 72 ].

Methylphenidate-analogous structures were checked for their DA transporter (DAT) affinities. The naphthyl derivatives (53 and 54), especially 2-naphthyl methylphenidate (54), had a higher affinity for DAT than methylphenidate (52) [73]. More recent studies from 2004 confirmed this trend [74]. In comparison with methylphenidate (52), the 3,4-dichloro derivative (55) shows a DA binding affinity that is fifty times better.

In an interesting article, Meltzer et al. showed that the anchor point previously believed to be necessary for interaction with monoamine transporters, the basic nitrogen, is not an absolute requirement [72] (Madras et al. already showed that the presence of a nitrogen atom is not essential for blocking the monoamine transporter is | 75]). So they explained, among other things, that the replacement of nitrogen
