(Atorvastatin: Lipitor速, Sortis速; 9, 2008 sales: 14.4 billion US $). It is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. In second place in terms of sales (6.1 billion US $) is the corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (Advair速, Seretide速; 10), it even has three fluorine atoms. It is used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. Aside from these two examples, there are dozens of others.


Actor in diagnostics

The 18F isotope (half-life 110min) has achieved great importance in radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic purposes because it emits positrons. A substance that contains the 18F-PET (positron emission tomography) nuclide instead of the natural 19F atom goes the same way in the body as the one with the natural 19F. This means that the substance enters into the same interactions with target proteins and constantly emits positrons on its way. The positrons react with the electrons present everywhere, emitting photons and thus annihilate themselves. This is why one speaks of so-called annihilation radiation. The emitted photons are made visible with detectors and allow - unlike normal X-rays - a three-dimensional view into the body, as individual cutting planes can be scanned and mapped.

If an 18F-labeled substance is administered, its distribution or accumulation in the body can be followed with the aid of a PET scanner, and those regions for which the substance has a high affinity can be identified. With additional information on the affinity to the target (receptor, enzyme, channel, transporter, etc.) one can deduce in which region of the body the target occurs. Fluoxetine (29, see also Chapter 3.10), which is marked with the 18F isotope, is used to find regions where it works; if it were an absolutely selective inhibitor of the serotonin transporter, one could see in which areas the serotonin transporters are located. Unfortunately, it turned out that fluoxetine (29) also has a high affinity for mitochondria and monoamine oxidase [5].
