A few years later, psychiatrist Nathan Kline was the first to understand iponiazid's (1) full potential in fighting depression. In 1957 Kline published together with Loomer and Saunders "A clinical and pharmacodynamic evaluation of iproniazid as a psychic energizer", which in turn found its way into the general public and was commented by TIME magazine under the title "Psychic energizer": "Medical researchers reported last week that they have found a sort of un-tranquilizer - a drug that shows promise in treating mental patients suffering from depression â€œa) [16].

A number of other hydrazine or hydrazide derivatives followed: Levy and his colleagues investigated amine oxidases [17, 18]. The hydrazine derivatives shown (5-11, see also Chapter 3.3) bind irreversibly to monoamine oxidase (MAO) and lead to serious liver damage, which is why they are now obsolete. The typical interactions that are inherently associated with an unselective and irreversible MAO inhibition (tyramine effect) are relatively controllable in comparison to hepatotoxicity.



At the end of the 1950s, tranyleypromine (12, safe Chapter 3.11 and excursus amine oxidases) also came into play as an unselective and almost irreversible MAO inhibitor [19]. Despite its interaction with tyramine-rich food, tranylcypromine (12) is still on the market for the treatment of therapy-resistant depression. It is not known to have any harmful effects on the liver. Although, according to statements from depressed patients, the effectiveness is very good and the intolerance to foods rich in tyramine is easy to calculate, it is now considered out of date.
