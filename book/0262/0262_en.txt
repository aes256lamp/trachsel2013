2-Aminoindane (2-AI, 14) is the positional isomer of 3 and can be regarded as an amphetamine (see Chapter 2) whose side chain is linked back to the phenyl ring. Because of its mirror axis it is achiral. 2-AI (14) showed significant bronchial dilation and an analgesic effect (summarized in [22]). Furthermore, 14 together with its N-methyl derivative was found to be less toxic than amphetamine in rats, and compared to l-ephedrine they were shown to be more effective bronchodilators [23].
Van der Schoot et al. showed that 2-Al (14) in mice (i.p. administration) stimulated locomotion by only 3% relative to amphetamine [1]. In a drug discrimination study with rats substituted 2-AI (14) for racemic amphetamine, however, proved to be only half as potent as this [2]. In another study with rats, 2-AI (14) was only able to partially substitute for amphetamine [24]. 2-AI (14) inhibited catecholamine uptake in brain regions (synaptosomes of the corpus striatum and the hypothalamÄ±) more than 1-AI (3) [12]. Compared to amphetamine, 14 showed a 50-fold higher binding affinity for PNMT [5].



In the past, self-experiments with 2-AI increased (14). If the few experience reports are to be believed, the effect is said to be similar to that of amphetamine [25]. According to other reports from Erowid, the analgesic effect observed in animal experiments could be confirmed. Sedating effects have also been described in higher doses. From the locomotion and discrimination studies it can be concluded that 2-AI (14) is very likely to have a much weaker stimulatory effect than amphetamine.
