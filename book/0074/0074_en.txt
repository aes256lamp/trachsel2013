Only a few data are available on the ß-substituted phenylalkylamines (Chapter 3,9, β-methyl-amphetamine (34), for example, showed the same blood pressure-increasing activity as amphetamine in dogs. With regard to toxicity, 35 proved to be half as toxic as in rabbits Amphetamine.


The ß,ß-disubstituted derivatives were also only sparsely investigated. Type 36 structures were supposed to be used to treat depression, and advancements and observations of weight loss as a "side effect" eventually led to sibutramine (37), a subsequently marketed anti-obesity. However, this was soon withdrawn from the market due to severe side effects (see Section 6.3).


Conclusion: alkyl substituents on the side chain: homologation of the α-Me group of amphetamine (3) leads to a loss of effectiveness. Special case: N, N-dimethylated prolintan (29) and analogous derivatives with a keto group in the ß-position. With an α, α-dialkylation, the stimulating properties are significantly reduced, the hunger-relieving effect, on the other hand, is retained (phentermine; 31). Beta-alkylation has been sparsely studied.



Variation of the amino position (Chapter 3.10)

In 1910, the two pioneers Barger and Dal were probably the first to present relationships between the structure and physiological effects of organic substances of the “amine” type. Among other things, they tested various amines for blood pressure. In terms of increasing blood pressure, 2-phenethylamine (41) was found to be the most effective phenylalkylamine (IV administration to cats), substances 38-40 were ineffective, and 42 showed only a weak effect. Thus, the distance of two carbon atoms is ideal in this regard. The amphetamine (3) not tested by them produces an increase in blood pressure even when administered orally.
