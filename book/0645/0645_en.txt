8. Trisubstituted phenylalkylamines

# General trends

The most potent psychedelics of the phenylalkylamine type in humans are obtained in the 2,4,5-series (Chapter 8.5), retaining a 2,5-dimethoxy substitution paired with a small, lipophilic 4-substituent (e.g. Me, Et, CF3, Cl, Br, I, SMe). Expansion of the 2-MeO group to a 2-EtO or 2-MeS substituent is less well tolerated than the same modification in the 5-position (see chapter 8.5.21). If one of the two MeO groups is replaced by another substituent, there is a massive (if not complete) loss of effect. In general, the most potent compounds are those with a 3C-unit (phenylisopropylamines; amphetamines, Fig. 2), followed by the 2C-derivatives (phenethylamines; see Chapter 8.5.15). The extension to an \alpha-ethyl group (4C-derivatives) generally leads to a considerable attenuation of effect (see Chapter 8.5.24).
A similar trend is evident from the limited data available for the 2,4,6-series (Chapter 8.6); here, a 2,6-dimethoxy substitution paired with a small, lipophilic 4-substituent appears to result in the most potent derivatives, and these
compounds are only slightly less potent than those of the 2,4,5-series.
The 3,4,5-trisubstituted phenylalkylamines, which are generally considered to be less potent in terms of dosage, ideally carry a 3,5-dimethoxy substitution paired with a small, lipophilic 4-substituent (see Chapter 8.4). It has been shown that quite a few 4-alkoxy or 4-alkylthio substituents with many possible variations (branching, alkenes, fluorination) are tolerated here and the compounds are psychedelically active in humans (see Chapters 8.4.8 and 8.4.9). In comparison to the well-studied 2,4,5-series, practically no investigations with 4-halo- or 4-alkyl substituents were carried out here. This may also be due to the more difficult chemical accessibility. Nevertheless, many active compounds exist. Interestingly, the 4-alkoxy substituents investigated so far (Chapters 8.4.8.2 and 8.4.10) are better tolerated in the 3,4,5-series than in the 2,4,5-series (see Chapters 8.5.5 and 8.5.6), where these substituents led to rather few active compounds. Also, a 3-MeS substituent in the 3,4,5-series is much less detrimental to potency (Chapters 8.4.9.2 and 8.4.9.3) than a 2-MeS or 5-MeS in the 2,4,5-series (Chapter 8.5.21). On average, the 2,4,5-trisubstituted phenylalkylamines appear to be significantly more potent in humans than the derivatives of the 3,4,5-series.

Fig. 2: Within the trisubstituted phenethylamines, those with a 3C structure (= phenylisopropylamine, amphetamine or also \alpha-methylphenethylamine) are usually the most potent psychoactive compounds in humans in terms of dosage, followed by the 2C and 4C derivatives. This trend also applies to most of the lower or higher substituted phenethylamines.
