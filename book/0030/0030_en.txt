still rarely used [9] - In addition, chloramphenicol (28) is one of the few natural substances that contains a nitro group.

Dopamine (DA, 29, see chapter 7.5.1). The name derives
from dihydroxy-phenethylamine. The neurotransmitter off
the group of catecholamines occurs in different brain areas of mammals. The substanceia nigra (black substance) is particularly rich in DA and has its color because DA with its ortho-dihydroxy structure is very sensitive to oxidation and easily transforms into quinoid systems that turn dark.
DA binds to five receptor subtypes (D1-D5) and regulates many processes in the brain that play crucial roles in human mental and physical health. It influences emotions such as joy, enjoyment or lust and is therefore also referred to as the messenger substance of the reward system. DA not only influences emotional processes in the CNS (middle, intermediate and cerebrum), it also coordinates movement sequences and is responsible for the blood flow to internal organs in the autonomic nervous system. Various clinical pictures such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's, erectile dysfunction or restless legs syndrome are associated with DA. DA is also related to addictive behavior: stimulants such as amphetamines achieve their effects primarily by releasing DA (and norepinephrine), which is why they are also known as indirect dopamine agonists.
This justifies the addiction potential of these substances. DA is also indirectly held responsible for the dependence on opioids, benzodiazepines, nicotine and others. It is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine (norepinephrine; 3) and Epinephrine (4).
