aesthetically popular with many mineral collectors. The fluorite, which is colorless in and of itself, can have almost any color due to small foreign admixtures, but radioactive radiation can also cause discoloration.

In contrast to other halogenated natural substances, the rarity of fluorine in naturally occurring compounds is remarkable because it is extremely useful in artificial everyday objects (Teflon, CFC), for uranium enrichment (UF6) as well as in pesticides and medicines. Its use helps to change molecular building blocks in a unique way. The question arises as to how much fluorinated drugs or their metabolites that have found their way into the environment are "resorbed" by nature and converted into new organofluorine compounds. However, these would then be partially anthropogenic connections.


Hero of Medicinal Chemistry

The improved activity in fluorinated steroids was discovered as early as 1953, followed in 1957 by the discovery of the extraordinary anti-cancer activity of 5-fluorouracil (8) [3].


Medicines that contain fluorinated active ingredients are common today. Their share is tending to rise and has been between 5 and 15 percent over the past fifty years [4]. For example, the drug with the highest turnover carries a fluorine atom
